<p>Supporting member authorities in strengthening their crisis preparedness is a pillar of the FSB&rsquo;s mandate to promote global financial stability.</p>
</blockquote>
</header>
<section class="post-content">
<p>Over 15 years of standard-setting by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), anchored in the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions and sectoral guidance, has laid a solid foundation for addressing financial crises. Several periods of turmoil have tested the resolution framework since its initial adoption in 2011.</p>
<p>These episodes highlighted its significant benefits but also uncovered gaps in the framework and its implementation, underscoring the need for better integration with broader crisis preparedness activities. A resilient global financial system depends on the ability of authorities to respond swiftly and effectively to financial institution distress or sectoral disruptions. This, in turn, requires thorough preparation by both authorities and financial institutions in advance of any potential failure.</p>
<p>The strategic review aims to:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>strengthen and, where necessary, adapt the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities to respond to changes and emerging vulnerabilities in the global financial system, drawing on lessons learnt from the crises that have occurred since the FSB&rsquo;s formation in 2009.</li>
<li>enhance the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities to consider all stages of a crisis, from early intervention measures through recovery and resolution to post-stabilisation restructuring.</li>
<li>refine internal processes and organisational structure to achieve the FSB&rsquo;s strategic objectives for crisis preparedness.</li>
<li>strengthen the central role of the Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions as the international standard for resolution regimes for financial institutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The FSB has appointed Andrea Enria, former Chair of the Supervisory Board of the European Central Bank and the first Chair of the European Banking Authority, to lead a high-level group who will conduct the strategic review of the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities. On his appointment, Mr Enria said, &ldquo;The ability to manage crises effectively is not just a technical requirement but a cornerstone of global financial stability. I am honoured to chair this strategic review of the FSB&rsquo;s crisis preparedness activities, which aims to ensure that the crisis management framework remains credible and fit for purpose.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>LSEG today launched Model-as-a-Service (MaaS), a new capability that enables financial institutions to host, distribute and analyse models through a secure and governed marketplace. Societe Generale has joined LSEG&rsquo;s model marketplace as a provider of advanced analytical models, making a set of its flagship datasets and analytics available to both firms&rsquo; clients.</p>
<p>As part of the partnership, seven Societe Generale datasets and analytics will be available via LSEG&rsquo;s model marketplace, covering Fixed Income, FX, ESG, and Equities. Clients will be able to access Societe Generale&rsquo;s flagship datasets and analytics alongside LSEG&rsquo;s own analytics, all through a single, integrated experience.</p>
<p>Through LSEG&rsquo;s strategic partnership with Microsoft, MaaS enables portfolio managers, risk teams and other market participants to access datasets, analytics &amp; models from multiple providers securely, and at scale, without the need for additional integration.</p>
<p>For institutions, MaaS offers a secure, scalable route to commercialisation; turning proprietary analytics into scalable and value-driven solutions, whilst reducing infrastructure, compliance, and go-to-market overhead. Powered by Model Context Protocol (MCP) connectors, MaaS also delivers models directly into LSEG&rsquo;s partners&rsquo; AI ecosystems, such as the availability of LSEG&rsquo;s MCP connector in Microsoft Copilot Studio.</p>
<p><span>Aysegul Erdem, Head of Modelling Solutions, LSEG,</span>&nbsp;said:<br />&ldquo;We are excited to onboard Societe Generale as one of our partners and provide them a trusted route to market which allows their data and analytics to be distributed, discovered, and adopted across institutions. By combining partner models with LSEG&rsquo;s trusted data and our global infrastructure, we are driving innovation and advancing the transformation of the financial model ecosystem.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Philippe Dufay, Head of Data &amp; Research Sales, Global Markets, Societe Generale,</span>&nbsp;said:<br />&ldquo;We are truly enthusiastic to partner with LSEG. This collaboration is a unique opportunity to bring our proprietary datasets and advanced analytics into a powerful platform, creating even greater value for our shared clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Bill Borden, Corporate Vice President, Worldwide Financial Services, Microsoft</span>, said:<br />&ldquo;LSEG&rsquo;s Model‑as‑a‑Service offering is an important step forward in helping financial institutions harness the power of advanced analytics and AI. Through Microsoft's strategic partnership with LSEG, we&rsquo;re giving financial institutions a streamlined path to better insights and accelerating innovation across the industry.&rdquo;</p>

<title>BME’s Ombudswoman Resolves 1,900 Inquiries In 2025, With More Requests From Issuing Entities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bmes-ombudswoman-resolves-1900-inquiries-in-2025-with-more-requests-from-issu-2026219/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bmes-ombudswoman-resolves-1900-inquiries-in-2025-with-more-requests-from-issu-2026219/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<ul>
<li><span>90% of the information requests received by BME&rsquo;s Ombudswoman Office come from retail investors</span></li>
<li><span>Inquiries from issuing entities grow from 2% to 8% due to high demand for certifications required to carry out corporate transactions such as tender offers</span></li>
<li><span>The report warns of the increase in potential scams through identity theft under the false pretext of offering investment products or advice on them</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME&rsquo;s Ombudswoman Office published its annual report today, detailing its activity in 2025. Last year, it received roughly 1,200 calls and more than 700 emails. Once again, retail investors account for the majority of inquiries (90%, compared to 95% the previous year), while 2% of the information requests come from market members and entities (versus 3% in 2024) and 8% from issuing entities, which represents a strong increase compared to the previous year, when they accounted for 2%.</p>
<p>The 300% increase in inquiries from issuing entities is due to the high demand for certifications required to carry out certain corporate transactions, such as tender offers.</p>
<p>Regarding the type of information requested, market information dominates (47%). This category includes inquiries about changes in quoted securities, fees applicable to trading activity, or historical quotes of securities admitted to trading on the Spanish stock exchange.</p>
<p>11% of inquiries relate to inside information and other relevant information from issuers, with particular emphasis on tender offers carried out during this period, such as Neinor&rsquo;s two-phase tender offer for Aedas, BBVA&rsquo;s for Sabadell, or Inocsa&rsquo;s for Grupo Catalana Occidente. Inquiries about shareholder remuneration and about trading suspensions and exclusions are also common.</p>
<p>Lastly, 42% of inquiries correspond to other miscellaneous matters, including topics such as voluntary renunciation of maintaining the registration of shares in Iberclear&rsquo;s registry, or shares of companies in liquidation or excluded from trading, as well as securities traded on other markets and BME&rsquo;s multilateral trading systems.</p>
<p>Once again, BME&rsquo;s Ombudswoman Office has also carried out a guiding role in inquiries and complaints outside its remit, such as issues in trading on international markets, identity theft offering advisory services, or matters related to patrimonial loss for tax purposes. In addition to the inquiries received, the Office has managed 19 contentious inquiry cases.</p>
<p>Gloria Mart&iacute;nez-Picazo, BME&rsquo;s Ombudswoman, explains that &ldquo;the Office is open to anyone with questions about the execution of transactions in the stock market, with special attention to retail investors of all ages. Year after year, we appreciate a significant increase in financial education among investors, a key factor in resolving queries and avoiding claims files.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the biggest risks for investors, once again this year, is potential scams involving identity impersonation by entities or firms (including BME) fraudulently offering investment services or financial advice. The report reminds us that BME never contacts individuals directly, does not offer investment services, does not request the delivery or transfer of money, and does not make investment recommendations.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Report includes a series of recommendations aimed at strengthening personalized and individualized attention to investors by the Customer Service of the entities, and urges them to proactively cancel fees associated with excluded and unproductive securities, following CNMV recommendations, as occurred this year with the costs related to shares of Seda de Barcelona and Abengoa warrants. Lastly, it urges the investor relations departments of issuers to carry out proactive work with their shareholders, particularly when they are the object or subject of operations relevant to the issuing company and therefore to its shareholders.</p>

<ul>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Collaboration enables like-for-like benchmarking of market abuse detection rates&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span> </li>
<li> <span><strong><em><span>Provides regulator-ready, explainable evidence trails grounded in real-world reconstructed order book behaviour</span></em></strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>BMLL, the leading independent provider of harmonised, historical Level 3, 2 and 1 data and analytics across global equity, ETFs, futures and US equity options, today announced a partnership with Features Analytics, an AI-driven trade surveillance and market integrity analytics provider. The partnership will support Features Analytics&rsquo; development and commercialisation of new surveillance benchmarking and integrity analytics built on top of BMLL&rsquo;s high-fidelity historical order book data.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bringing market integrity analytics to life on high-precision historical order books</span></p>
<p><span>Trade surveillance and market integrity analytics require high-quality historical order book data to reconstruct market and trading behaviour, provide context, measure risk and enable explainability.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Combining BMLL&rsquo;s historical Level 3, 2 and 1 order book data and Features Analytics&rsquo; AI-driven detection approach accelerates the launch of new data products. Specifically, the collaboration enables rapid development of proprietary Features Analytics products designed to address model benchmarking and risk measurement challenges in trade surveillance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a result, Features Analytics&rsquo; solutions help improve surveillance precision and reduce the operational burden driven by legacy, parameter-heavy approaches, where firms can face extremely high false positives and ongoing calibration costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Measuring and benchmarking market abuse detection rates</span></p>
<p><span>By developing these products, BMLL and Features Analytics open up a new category of surveillance benchmarking data that enables firms to independently measure how their incumbent surveillance stack is performing, both over time and against market conditions. This enables like-for-like benchmarking of market abuse detection rates across existing solutions, while providing regulator-ready, explainable evidence trails grounded in real-world reconstructed order book behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Paul Humphrey, Chief Executive Officer of BMLL, said:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Market integrity and surveillance are a natural application layer on top of high-quality historical order book data. This partnership reflects our focus on enabling sophisticated workflows on top of BMLL data, now extending beyond market quality into market integrity and surveillance benchmarking use cases.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cristina Soviany, PhD, Chief Executive Officer and Co-founder of Features Analytics, added:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Our mission is to help financial institutions stay ahead of regulatory requirements with our unique eyeDES&reg;&nbsp;AI technology and tools that deliver measurable coverage and accurate detection of market abuse. Access to deep, harmonised, high-quality historical order book data through BMLL&rsquo;s Activate program supports faster development and validation of the new products we are bringing to market.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Partnership anchored in Features Analytics&rsquo; participation in the &lsquo;BMLL Activate: Data Credits Program&rsquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Features Analytics participated in the &lsquo;BMLL Activate: Data Credits Program&rsquo;, a time-limited initiative designed to enable qualified partners to build and validate new products on top of BMLL historical order book data with no upfront data licence cost during the build period, and a clear conversion path to longer-term commercial deployment. Under the BMLL Activate program, BMLL provides Features Analytics with a BMLL data allowance (credits) redeemable against defined-scope usage of the BMLL Data Lab (Python research sandbox) and access to the BMLL Data Feed.</span></p>

<title>Number Go Down And Other Schadenfreude: Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, ETHDenver, Denver, CO, Feb. 18, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;I am honored to be on stage today with Chairman Paul Atkins. Before we begin, let me remind you that my statements and his are our own in our official capacities and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Commission or our fellow Commissioner. Chairman Atkins needs little introduction, but let me give you a brief bio for him.</p>
<p>Paul S. Atkins was sworn into office as the 34th Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 21 of last year. Prior to returning to the SEC, Chairman Atkins was most recently chief executive of Patomak Global Partners, a consulting firm he founded in 2009. Chairman Atkins previously served as a Commissioner of the SEC from 2002 to 2008. During his tenure, he advocated for transparency, consistency, and the use of cost-benefit analysis at the agency. Chairman Atkins began his career as a lawyer in New York, focusing on a wide range of corporate transactions for U.S. and foreign clients, including public and private securities offerings and mergers and acquisitions. He was resident for 2&frac12; years in his firm&rsquo;s Paris office and admitted as conseil juridique in France. A member of the New York and Florida bars, Chairman Atkins received his J.D. from Vanderbilt University School of Law and his A.B., Phi Beta Kappa, from Wofford College in 1980. Originally from Lillington, North Carolina, Chairman Atkins grew up in Tampa, Florida. He and his wife Sarah have three sons.</p>
<p>One other interesting fact about Chairman Atkins is that he speaks German and French fluently. He likely is looking for another language to add to his repertoire. Mr. Chairman, have you considered learning Solidity?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;No need. Vibe coding works just fine. It is a big step up from the BASIC-PLUS and COBOL I used in college.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;Fair point, Mr. Chairman, but if the smart contract your AI writes starts saying everything is a security, we&rsquo;ll suspect AI hallucination. A few years ago, if someone had told me that I would be standing at a crypto conference with the Chairman of the SEC, I would have thought that person was hallucinating. But we&rsquo;re here, so let&rsquo;s get to some substance. During the past year, the SEC under the leadership of Chairman Atkins and Acting Chairman Uyeda in the early part of the year has taken a lot of steps toward crypto clarity. We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sought and received written responses to multiple sets of difficult questions covering a wide range of crypto topics;</li>
<li>Held several in-depth roundtables on discrete topics including the definition of a security, trading, custody, tokenization, DeFi, and privacy;</li>
<li>Met with many developers and builders in Washington D.C., virtually, and in crypto-on-the-road meetings in cities across the country;</li>
<li>Provided technical assistance to Congress as it works on crypto legislation;</li>
<li>Launched a new initiative with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to build a lasting basis for coordination and cooperation in regulating areas of joint interest, including crypto;</li>
<li>Ended regulation by enforcement;</li>
<li>Issued multiple staff guidance documents and frequently asked questions to help people understand what the SEC staff thinks is and is not within the SEC&rsquo;s jurisdiction (including on issues like mining, staking, meme coins, and stable coins), and how regulated entities engaging with crypto can comply with our existing rules;</li>
<li>Got rid of unhelpful staff guidance, such as SAB 121;</li>
<li>Published a staff statement on the custody of crypto asset securities by broker-dealers;</li>
<li>Issued a cross-divisional staff statement outlining a taxonomy for tokenized securities;</li>
<li>Approved exchange generic listing standards for crypto ETPs;</li>
<li>Issued staff no-action letters to several projects, including on tokenization and DePIN; and</li>
<li>Began the process of designing rules, exemptive relief, and Commission interpretations, which will help to form the basis for a durable regulatory framework.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mr. Chairman, can you give us a preview of what to expect this year on the crypto regulatory front?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;We have a lot on our plate. Not only will we continue to engage with Congress on its important efforts, but, as you noted, we will move forward with our regulatory work through Project Crypto, which is now a joint initiative with the CFTC. As you all know, one of our own, Mike Selig, who Hester brought to the SEC as Chief Counsel of the Crypto Task Force in my office, is now CFTC Chairman now. We are planning great things together &ndash; harmonization, joint rulemaking &ndash; a common, coordinated approach unlike anything seen before of these two, often sparring agencies. As for the SEC, I expect the Commission and staff to consider the following in the coming weeks and months:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Commission framework to explain how we think about crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract. How is such an investment contract formed? And how is it terminated?;</li>
<li>An innovation exemption to facilitate limited trading of certain tokenized securities on novel platforms with an eye toward developing a long-term regulatory framework;</li>
<li>A rulemaking proposal to establish common-sense pathways for people to raise capital in connection with the sale of crypto assets;</li>
<li>No-action letters and exemptive orders to provide additional clarity, including to address wallets and other user interfaces that are not subject to registration under the Exchange Act;</li>
<li>Rulemaking on custody of non-security crypto assets, including payment stablecoins, by broker-dealers;</li>
<li>A transfer agent modernization rulemaking which will accommodate the role that blockchain can play in recordkeeping; and</li>
<li>Additional guidance and no-action letters to help people understand how existing rules apply to their unique factual circumstances.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;Sounds like a lot of work, but for securities nerds like us, this experience is a bit like the Olympics. It&rsquo;s nearly as exhilarating as hurtling downhill at 80 mph and doing acrobatics after getting big air off the ski jump or doing backflips after a quadruple lutz on ice. While not as dramatic as our talented Olympic champions, we have an unusual opportunity to consider many complex regulatory issues in light of this new technology. This task too will require some acrobatics, and we are not looking to hurt or break anything other than unwarranted regulatory impediments to technological progress.</p>
<p>I want to talk for a minute about an innovation exemption, which has inspired hopes and fears that may need some moderation. Indeed, the way people talk about it now reminds me of the expectations that people have when they buy an abandoned storage unit; they are sure it will contain a rare work of art and a trunk full of gold bars. So too some people are certain the innovation exemption will cure all their regulatory headaches. Some people in TradFi, by contrast, seem to think that the soon-to-be-opened storage unit contains a monster that will swallow all of TradFi in one ugly bite. They fear the innovation exemption will let crypto firms ignore all the rules. Both groups are likely to realize that the innovation exemption is not as monumental as either faction anticipated. It would be an important step toward facilitating the integration of tokenized securities into our existing financial system, but it would not change the entire financial system overnight. We are working incrementally now, as we have always done. The goal is to facilitate the organic incorporation of new technology in a way that enhances the dynamism and resilience of the system so that it can serve investors, companies, and other users of capital effectively. Paul, please describe what you have in mind with the innovation exemption.</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;I would like to consider an innovation exemption to enable incumbents and crypto-native to experiment. For example, people trading certain tokenized securities through automated market makers, even though no one person or group of persons may be controlling that mechanism. In my view, market participants should be able to engage with decentralized applications on public, permissionless blockchains if they desire. But I expect, however, that many Americans will be more comfortable allowing intermediaries to custody and trade on their behalf. Individual investors, not the SEC, should make the decision. I also would like to consider whether there should be a safe harbor for participants who may be facilitating such trading.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to consider how issuers that want to tokenize their securities could work with a transfer agent or other tokenization agent to tokenize their securities so that they can be traded onchain in AMMs or other trading systems, environments, or platforms that offer decentralized liquidity. Under this possible approach, the innovation exemption would limit trading volume and could provide relief from some of our rules and certain other requirements that may not be relevant in light of how this technology works. Buyers and sellers of the tokenized securities would go through a white-listing process. The exemption would be temporary but would last long enough for us to consider developing new rules and amending existing rules to allow such trading to continue under appropriate conditions in the future and to enable any parties that need to do so to register. I would welcome feedback on this potential approach.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;Thanks for giving us a peek into the storage locker. No Picassos, but no scary monsters either. Just an incremental step from which market participants can learn and which may help get us to a fit-for-purpose, long-term regulatory framework. Speaking of new things, you and I have both seen some demos to show us how some of this technology, such as decentralized trading, works. Has anything struck you about what you&rsquo;ve seen?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;One interesting aspect of the technology is the ability to embed compliance into the smart contract&rsquo;s code. A company&rsquo;s founders, for example, could code their commitment not to resell their securities for a certain period of time into the smart contract governing tokenized securities. Likewise, we can reimagine communications between issuers and their security-holders through the use of blockchain. And privacy-preserving technologies, such as zero-knowledge proofs, can revolutionize how we achieve the goals of the Bank Secrecy Act. Under this model, Americans would not have to relinquish their privacy wholesale to financial institutions, and these intermediaries would have lower compliance costs.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;That sounds promising. I worry a lot about how embedded financial surveillance is in our financial system. Americans have an opportunity to use this new technology to protect themselves from bad actors while also protecting our nation from our adversaries. We should take advantage of this moment to reacquaint ourselves with how important financial privacy is to the security of the American people.</p>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s address the elephant in the room: what do you think about the falling crypto prices of late? Is it time to focus our attention on this issue? Should regulators panic or even care that prices are down?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;It is not the regulator&rsquo;s job to worry about the daily swings of the markets; it&rsquo;s our job to make sure market participants have the disclosures they need to make informed investment decisions. People whose only focus is on the number always going up are likely to be disappointed, whether they are buying stocks, precious metals, or crypto. Markets go up and markets go down in response to many factors. As regulators, the best thing we can do is to ensure that the rules governing the asset classes we regulate enable people to have the information they need to express their market sentiments through decisions about whether to buy the assets at issue.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;I agree. &ldquo;Number go down&rdquo; is the mantra of the moment, and some crypto critics are dancing in the streets. In German, we would call this reaction &ldquo;Schadenfreude,&rdquo; which translates as something like &ldquo;happiness about destruction.&rdquo; In this context maybe we should call their attitude Ethbelowthreeglee or Bitcoinunderseventylevity. But the best way to respond to these critics is not to look around desperately for some regulatory change that will cause the number to go up again. Sure, regulatory clarity in the form of legislation and regulation can help to create a conducive environment for building. But regulation is not the well from which value springs. You have to build stuff that people want and need. That is the best way to garner support on both sides of the aisle in Washington. If people are actually using something, government will be reluctant to take it away. Mr. Chairman, can you share some lessons from your many years of working in the capital markets about how innovators can successfully engage with the regulatory system?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;I agree with you that building useful things that people want and need speaks volumes in Washington. This technology, if developed carefully, could have a transformative effect on the financial system as securities move onchain. Tokenization could transform the financial system as we know it by, for example, shortening settlement cycles, facilitating the movement of collateral and dividends, facilitating proxy voting, or making it easier for people to construct and manage bespoke, diversified portfolios of investments. We stand ready to work with entrepreneurs who are building for a better future.</p>
<p>I hate to repeat an oft-mocked phrase from the last administration, but &ldquo;Come in and talk to us.&rdquo; We will not put our thumbs on the scale in favor of any particular asset or technology, nor will we become your spokesmen, but we want our markets to be open to people offering new products and services. Our rulebook should not be the barrier to innovation that would further our objectives of protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and fostering fair, orderly, and efficient markets.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;You have captured the balance well. We are not cheerleaders of any new asset or technology, but we want our markets to welcome people who have ideas about how to improve them. The SEC has not always been very welcoming. Regulation, if done wrong, can deny the American people benefits they otherwise would enjoy. For example, an unwillingness to work productively with issuers of tokens led to the perverse result that tokens that gave no meaningful rights to their holders were less likely to attract negative regulatory attention than rights-bearing tokens. As a result, we now live in a world in which most tokens do not give their owners any rights. I would like to get to a place in which project developers would not fear to create tokens that carry some claim on revenue streams and thus are securities. Paul, what would it take to get to a place where people would create tokens that fall unashamedly into the securities bucket?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;We need to continue doing what we are doing&mdash;providing clarity about how tokenized securities interact with existing regulation and how intermediaries dealing with tokenized securities can trade and custody them on behalf of their clients. This work can only be done in a collaborative fashion, and we welcome input from everyone, even crypto naysayers who are fully immersed in their Schadenfreude. I encourage people in the audience to think about what attributes a token should have to make it useful to people, and then work with us on a regulatory framework that accommodates these attributes without compromising our important regulatory objectives. But this process will take time, and innovators shouldn&rsquo;t necessarily wait for these changes before they start building. While we have these bigger conversations about whether fundamental changes should be made to our rulebooks, talking to us to see if there&rsquo;s a way to make the current rules work under your particular facts and circumstances may be a necessary interim step.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;Paul, you&rsquo;re known for your good cheer even in the face of difficult circumstances. Any words of advice in closing for an audience that is in the throes of a challenging crypto market?</p>
<p><span>Chairman Atkins:</span>&nbsp;Put your nose to the grindstone and work to build things that matter. That is how you transform Schadenfreude to Freudenfreude &ndash; the sense of happiness we feel when others succeed. A little dark chocolate and Diet Coke might help too, but go easy on the Celsius and Zyn.</p>
<p><span>Commissioner Peirce:</span>&nbsp;Thank you, Paul.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has issued a new information sheet for operators of employee entitlement schemes outlining our approach to regulation of these schemes under&nbsp;<em>the Corporations Act 2001</em>&nbsp;(Corporations Act), commencing 1 April 2026.<br /><br />In November 2025,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/asic-announces-approach-to-regulation-of-employee-redundancy-funds/" title="ASIC announces approach to regulation of employee redundancy funds">ASIC announced that operators of employee entitlement schemes will be subject to additional transparency and governance requirements and need to apply to ASIC for an Australian financial services (AFS) licence by 1 September 2026</a>.&nbsp;<br /><br />Information Sheet 295 Employee entitlement schemes (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/information-sheets/employee-entitlement-schemes/" title="Employee entitlement schemes">INFO 295</a>) explains:</p>
<ul>
<li>transitional relief that will be available for operators from 1 April 2026 until an AFS licence is granted by ASIC</li>
<li>the process for an operator to apply for an AFS licence with the relevant authorisations by 1 September 2026, and</li>
<li>obligations that will apply to operators under the Corporations Act and conditions of ASIC&rsquo;s ongoing relief.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC will make a new legislative instrument in March 2026 to provide transitional and ongoing relief to operators of employee entitlement schemes from certain provisions of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>We will undertake targeted consultation with operators of existing schemes prior to finalising the instrument.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For December</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-december-2026218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/treasury-international-capital-data-for-december-2026218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for December 2025.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for January 2026, is scheduled for March 18, 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in December of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $44.9 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $32.7 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $12.2 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in December; their net purchases were $62.9 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $55.7 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $7.2 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $34.9 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $28.0 billion in December.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $9.7 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $12.1 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased&nbsp;by $4.8 billion.</p>
<p>Complete data are available on the Treasury website&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">here</a>.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<title>SEC Proposes Amendments To Reduce Burdens In Reporting Of Fund Portfolio Holdings - Commission Also Extends Compliance Dates For Names Rule Reporting</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-proposes-amendments-to-reduce-burdens-in-reporting-of-fund-portfolio-holding-2026218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sec-proposes-amendments-to-reduce-burdens-in-reporting-of-fund-portfolio-holding-2026218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today proposed amendments to the form used by most registered investment companies to report portfolio-related information. The changes are designed to reduce reporting burdens without significantly affecting the SEC&rsquo;s use of the data or the public&rsquo;s ability to assess relevant information about a fund.</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to Form N-PORT follow a review (in accordance with a Presidential Memorandum) of the amendments the Commission made to the form in 2024. The proposal considers developments that have occurred after the Commission&rsquo;s adoption of those amendments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reducing unnecessary reporting burdens and increasing efficiency in disclosure requirements is a top priority of the Commission,&rdquo; said SEC Chairman Paul S. Atkins. &ldquo;This proposal provides registrants additional time to file the form, refines reporting items, and reduces the frequency of public reporting of fund portfolio holdings &ndash; all the while retaining insight into funds&rsquo; portfolio-related issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proposed amendments to Form N-PORT would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide reporting funds with an additional 15 days to file monthly reports of portfolio-related information on Form N-PORT, which is designed to reduce the potential for errors and resubmissions</li>
<li>Reduce the publication of reports from monthly to quarterly, a change designed to protect a fund&rsquo;s shareholders by reducing the risks of more frequent public disclosure, such as external parties using information about a fund&rsquo;s portfolio holdings in ways that increase costs for the fund and its shareholders</li>
<li>Modify Form N-PORT reports to streamline or remove certain reported information, including removing &ldquo;Names Rule&rdquo; reporting, and add information about funds with share classes that operate as exchange-traded funds</li>
</ul>
<p>In connection with the proposed amendments, but by separate action, the Commission is extending the compliance dates for those Form N-PORT reporting requirements related to the &ldquo;Names Rule&rdquo; under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which addresses certain investment company names. This extension will provide additional time for funds and the Commission to consider the proposed amendments to Form N-PORT and avoid certain costs associated with regulatory requirements that the Commission is proposing to eliminate.</p>
<p>The new compliance dates are Nov. 17, 2027, for fund groups with net assets of $10 billion or more and May 18, 2028, for fund groups with less than $10 billion in net assets as of the end of their most recent fiscal year.</p>
<p>The proposing release for Form N-PORT amendments will be published in the Federal Register, and the public comment period will remain open until 60 days after the Federal Register publication date.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury Announces Public-Private Initiative To Strengthen Cybersecurity And Risk Management For AI</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>n support of the President&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf">AI Action Plan</a>, the U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the conclusion of a major public-private initiative to strengthen cybersecurity and risk management for artificial intelligence (AI) in the financial services sector. Over the course of February, Treasury will release a series of six resources developed in partnership with industry and federal and state regulatory partners to enable secure and resilient AI across the U.S. financial system.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As this Administration has made clear, it is imperative that the United States take the lead on developing innovative uses for artificial intelligence, and nowhere is that more important than in the financial sector,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. &ldquo;This work demonstrates that government and industry can come together to support secure AI adoption that increases the resilience of our financial system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Artificial Intelligence Executive Oversight Group (AIEOG), a partnership between the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fbiic.gov/">Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://fsscc.org/">Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council</a>, brought together senior executives from financial institutions, federal and state financial regulators, and other key stakeholders. Together, participants focused on addressing identified gaps in the financial sector&rsquo;s use of AI, developing practical tools that financial institutions can use to manage AI-specific cybersecurity risks while unleashing innovation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Treasury brought public- and private-sector partners together to develop practical tools that can effect real change in the financial sector through the AIEOG,&rdquo; said Cory Wilson, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection. &ldquo;These resources are designed to help institutions, particularly small and mid-sized institutions, harness the power of AI to strengthen cyber defenses and deploy AI more securely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treasury will release the AIEOG deliverables in stages throughout February. The AIEOG workstreams provide a foundation for the use of AI in financial services, addressing governance, data practices, transparency, fraud, and digital identity in an integrated way. By focusing on practical implementation rather than prescriptive requirements, the resources are intended to help financial institutions adopt AI more confidently and securely, strengthening resilience and cybersecurity while supporting innovation across the sector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through our public-private partnership, FSSCC and Treasury have taken an important step to address complex challenges posed by AI&rdquo; said William S. Demchak, PNC Chairman &amp; CEO, and AIEOG executive member.&nbsp;&ldquo;By clearly identifying and addressing the associated risks, financial institutions&mdash;regardless of size&mdash;are now positioned to harness the full power of this transformative technology, driving innovation and value for their clients while strengthening multiple facets of their organizations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through this work, Treasury advances the President&rsquo;s AI Action Plan and the National Cybersecurity Strategy by strengthening the security of AI data, infrastructure, and models in the financial sector, promoting best practices for secure AI deployment, and driving adoption of American AI systems globally.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="sizeable">TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV) today announced the 2026 TSX Venture 50, an annual ranking of the top-performing companies over the course of 2025. The list showcases a historic year for junior mining and high-tech innovation, reflecting an increase in global investor demand and market confidence in the Canadian capital markets at a time when resource security, critical technologies, and domestic supply chains have become strategic priorities worldwide.</p>
<p class="sizeable">TSX Venture 50 assesses TSXV issuers' year-long performance across three equally-weighted indicators&mdash;market capitalization growth, share price appreciation, and Canadian consolidated trading value. The companies on this year's ranking reached a combined market capitalization of more than $21.5 billion, representing a $17.9 billion increase during 2025&mdash;the largest since the program's inception in 2006. On average, these top performers grew their market value by 775% year-over-year and delivered a 431% share price increase for investors, outpacing the 333% average market cap growth and 207% average returns recorded on the 2025 list.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"The 2026 TSX Venture 50 reflects a clear inflection point for early-stage finance, with a return of liquidity and capital that reinforces Canada's position as a world-leading centre for resource discovery, strategic innovation, and scale," said Andrew Creech, President, TSX Venture Exchange. "This year's ranking underscores the vital role TSXV plays in channeling capital to the mining sector and serving as the primary growth pipeline for the next generation of global mineral supply."</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Mining's Record Performance Reflects Supercycle Gains</h2>
<p class="sizeable">The 2026 ranking consists of 48 mining companies, accounting for a total market cap of $19.9 billion and a 443% average share price increase. The sector's exceptional performance reflects a new global financing cycle driven by geopolitical uncertainties and industrial policy shifts that have increased investor demand for metals and minerals. The majority of the ranked mining firms are focused on gold and silver, supported by record commodity prices, while the remaining mining companies are advancing critical minerals projects needed for complex technology and energy transition.</p>
<p class="sizeable">Topping the list is British Columbia-based Santacruz Silver Mining Ltd. (<a class="blank" href="https://money.tmx.com/quote/SCZ" rel="external" target="_blank">TSXV:SCZ</a>), which finished 2025 with a 1,137% market cap growth alongside a 1,103% appreciation in share price. Second-ranked Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (<a class="blank" href="https://money.tmx.com/quote/UCU" rel="external" target="_blank">TSXV:UCU</a>), a Nova Scotia-headquartered company focusing on supplying high-value light and heavy rare earths, achieved a 1,109% increase in market cap.</p>
<p class="sizeable">The sector's dominance also reflects the essential role junior miners play as the primary pipeline for future producing assets, driving global exploration and discovery activity across key mining jurisdictions. Nearly 80% of the TSX Venture 50 mining companies operate in the tier-1 mining jurisdictions of the Americas, with 16 holding properties in Canada (concentrated in the Yukon and Ontario), 15 in the United States (primarily Nevada and Alaska), and 14 in Mexico.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Technology Companies Highlight Innovation in Security and Defence</h2>
<p class="sizeable">While mining dominated returns, three Canadian technology companies on the 2026 ranking demonstrated how defence, security, and quantum innovation are also attracting growth capital. Ontario-based Volatus Aerospace Inc. (<a class="blank" href="https://money.tmx.com/quote/FLT" rel="external" target="_blank">TSXV:FLT</a>) led the way at 16th place with a market cap increase of 441% and a 279% share price appreciation as demand for integrated aerial solutions for commercial and defence applications accelerates. Quantum eMotion Corp. (<a class="blank" href="https://money.tmx.com/quote/QNC" rel="external" target="_blank">TSXV:QNC</a>), a cybersecurity solutions firm headquartered in Quebec, recorded the highest overall trading value on this year's list at over $1.9 billion and saw its market cap rise by 269%. Meanwhile, Gatekeeper Systems Inc. (<a class="blank" href="https://money.tmx.com/quote/GSI" rel="external" target="_blank">TSXV:GSI</a>), a BC-based provider of vehicle video safety solutions, saw its share price grow by 225%.</p>
<h2 class="sizeable">Strong Financing and Trading Volumes Underpin Market Momentum</h2>
<p class="sizeable">This year's TSX Venture 50 cohort achieved the strongest liquidity metrics in the program's history, with 2025 trading volumes doubling year-over-year to exceed 13.2 billion shares traded. The robust trading activity supports company valuations on TSXV as global investors increasingly recognize Canada as the world's leading hub for junior mining and high-growth innovation financing.</p>
<p class="sizeable">"Collectively, 43 of the TSX Venture 50 companies completed capital raises during 2025, totaling over $1.5 billion of equity capital raised," said Robert Peterman, Chief Commercial Officer, TSX &amp; Global Capital Formation. "At the same time, we saw strong liquidity driven by global investor interest in the materials sector. This liquidity surge demonstrates that TSXV continues its position as the premier destination for early-stage public capital formation, particularly in the resource sector, cementing Canada's role as the foundation for global resource security and economic resilience."</p>

<title>The EBA ESG Dashboard Update Shows Stable Climate Risk Indicators</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the latest edition of its ESG risk dashboard, integrating data up to the second quarter of 2025.&nbsp;The dashboard reflects the latest changes in banks 'exposures to climate risks and aims to provide background information to support institutions and authorities in managing these risks. The new release confirms continued stability across major climate related risk indicators, broadly in line with the patterns observed in previous updates.</span></p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; exposures to sectors that significantly contribute to climate change remained elevated at around 62%, reflecting the importance of climate-sensitive industries in their non-financial corporate portfolios, warranting continuous efforts to develop and maintain robust climate risk management tools and monitoring frameworks.</p>
<p>Environmental data quality continued to improve. Exposures secured by immovable property showed strong energy-efficiency scores, while banks&rsquo; reliance on proxy indicators has declined by approximately 10 percentage points since December 2023, signalling better data coverage and more reliable sustainability assessments.</p>
<p>Physical risk metrics remained heterogeneous across jurisdictions, likely due to methodological differences among institutions. This variability highlights the inherent&nbsp; complexity of measuring physical risk across diverse European geographies and datasets.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>With this edition, the ESG Risk Dashboard becomes part of the Data Access Portal (EDAP), the EBA&rsquo;s central hub for supervisory data in the EU/EEA. Publishing the Dashboard within EDAP represents a major step forward in transparency and accessibility, enabling users to access all supervisory data tools in a single, integrated environment.</p>
<p>The ESG dashboard presents data from a representative sample of nearly 120 large EU/EEA banks, aggregating exposures and risk indicators at both country and anonymised bank level. The sample includes banks reporting under Pillar 3 ESG disclosure requirements, ensuring comparability across institutions.</p>
<p>Following the issuance of the EBA no-action letter on 5 August 2025 (<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-issues-no-action-letter-application-esg-disclosure-requirements-and-updates-eba-esg-risks">LINK</a>) , the charts under the &ldquo;Taxonomy Alignment&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the GAR/BTAR&rdquo; tabs have not been updated beyond Q4 2024 data.</p>

<title>ESMA: Upcoming Changes To The Euribor Panel</title>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, is issuing a statement on the upcoming changes to the Euribor panel, in its capacity as supervisor of the European Money Market Institute (EMMI), administrator of Euribor.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">This statement concerns the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.emmi-benchmarks.eu/globalassets/documents/pdf/communication/statements/26-02-18---emmi-press-release---euribor-panel-update.pdf">announcement by EMMI</a>&nbsp;that Barclays Bank PLC (BBPLC), based in the United Kingdom, will withdraw from the Euribor panel. The withdrawal will take effect on 27 February 2026, which will be the bank&rsquo;s final day contributing input data to the benchmark determination.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA and National Competent Authorities within the Euribor College of Supervisors have assessed the impact of the departure of BBPLC on Euribor representativeness of the Euro unsecured money market.&nbsp;<span>ESMA and the College concluded that BBPLC&rsquo;s departure does not pose a risk to the representativeness of Euribor.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>This departure follows a period of Euribor panel enlargement with the addition of three new panel banks since 2022 (More information:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-and-austrian-financial-market-authority-welcome-euribor-panel-enlargement">1</a><span>,</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/euribor-panel-include-finlands-op-corporate-bank-and-national-bank-greece">2</a><span>).&nbsp;ESMA views positively that EMMI's announcement also indicates that another bank will soon join the Euribor panel. ESMA continues to encourage credit institutions active in the Euro unsecured money market to consider joining the Euribor panel, actively supporting the robustness and representativeness of this critical benchmark within the EU financial system.</span></p>

<title>ECB And ONCE Foundation Launch Collaboration To Ensure Digital Euro Is Accessible For Everyone</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Collaboration will ensure digital euro is universally accessible in line with principles of equality, social inclusion and non-discrimination</li>
<li>ECB will leverage ONCE Foundation expertise to ensure digital euro app is easy to use and accessible, including for people with disabilities</li>
<li>ONCE Foundation to provide technical advice and test accessibility of digital euro app prototypes</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) and the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="https://www.fundaciononce.es/en/about-us/introduction">ONCE Foundation for Cooperation and Social Inclusion of People with Disabilities</a>&nbsp;have signed a collaboration agreement to promote, develop and ensure the digital euro app is easily accessible for everyone, including people with disabilities or limited digital skills and older adults.</p>
<p>The ECB will benefit from the foundation&rsquo;s expertise in three main areas: (i) providing technical advice on the accessibility requirements and features of the digital euro app, (ii) collaboration on the design of the digital euro app, and (iii) testing the accessibility of digital euro app functionalities once the first prototypes are available.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accessibility and inclusion are not optional features, but core digital euro design principles,&rdquo; said ECB Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. &ldquo;By working with organisations such as the ONCE Foundation, we are helping to ensure that the digital euro empowers every citizen in the digital age, leaving no one behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jes&uacute;s Hern&aacute;ndez Gal&aacute;n, Director of Accessibility and Innovation at the ONCE Foundation, stated: &ldquo;It is an honour to contribute to ensuring that the digital euro integrates accessibility features from the very beginning. We will incorporate experts in accessibility and user experience who are persons with disabilities into the project team, thereby combining technical knowledge with lived experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This collaboration also supports the ECB&rsquo;s ambition to further enhance the accessibility of the digital euro app beyond minimum legal accessibility requirements, as laid out in the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline external" href="http://data.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/882/oj">European Accessibility Act</a>, and standard market practice. The ECB is committed to adopting an &ldquo;accessibility by design&rdquo; approach for the digital euro app, embedding accessibility considerations from the earliest stages of design and development, ensuring the app is clear, understandable and easy to navigate. The outcome of this work could also inform user experience requirements for payment service providers.</p>
<p>Digital financial inclusion is integral to the technical design of the digital euro. In the context of the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/groups/erpb/html/index.en.html">Euro Retail Payments Board</a>, consumer organisations highlighted the need of a digital euro app provided by the Eurosystem and accessible to all as a&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/timeline/profuse/shared/pdf/ecb.deprep251030_digital_euro_fit_payment_ecosystem_report.en.pdf">critical tool for ensuring universal access to the digital euro</a>. Moreover, the first&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.pr250926_1~99b4b5b526.en.html">digital euro innovation platform</a>, involving around 70 market participants, found that the digital euro could also improve inclusion and accessibility through user-friendly features such as voice-controlled transactions, large-font displays and guided onboarding processes.</p>
<p>The ECB is committed to actively&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/html/pubcon.en.html">involving the public</a>&nbsp;in the development of the digital euro to gain valuable insights into the needs and preferences of potential users.&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/progress/html/ecb.deprp202510.en.html#toc10">Focus groups</a>&nbsp;with vulnerable consumers highlighted the need for multiple onboarding options, including in-person support at local branches, and payment flows which resemble familiar experiences. Participants emphasised the value of reassurance, simplicity and control over personal finances, particularly for those less confident with digital tools.</p>
<p>This collaboration, which is not remunerated, is in line with current European regulations on accessibility, fundamental rights and digital transformation, as well as the promotion of European standards that ensure a digital euro that would offer a user-friendly experience for all citizens, including those in vulnerable situations.</p>
<h4>Notes</h4>

<p><span><b>Dividend proposal at the 2026 Annual General Meeting</b></span><br /><br /></p>
<p align="justify"><span>A dividend of &euro;321.5 million will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2026. This represents 50% of 2025 reported net income, in line with Euronext&rsquo;s dividend policy. This dividend represents an increase of +9.8% compared to 2024</span><span>8</span><span>.</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><b>Euronext continues its cost discipline and invests in strategic growth</b></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>2025 was a year of investments with new hirings to support the delivery of the strategic growth initiatives. In 2025, Euronext reported underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) in line with the revised guidance of &euro;660 million. This compares to an initial guidance of &euro;670 million, which did not take into account the impact of any acquisitions executed over the course of 2025. Including the acquisitions of Admincontrol and Athex Group, Euronext recorded &euro;680.1 million of underlying expenses excluding D&amp;A.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Euronext expects its underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) for 2026 to be stable compared to the normalised annualised Q4 2025 expenses, at around &euro;720 million. In addition, Euronext expects around &euro;35 million of operating expenses from Athex Group and plans to invest around &euro;15 million of underlying expenses to deliver strategic growth projects. As a result, Euronext expects its total underlying expenses (excl. D&amp;A) for 2026 to be around &euro;770 million.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><b>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</b></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><i>"2025 was an excellent start to our &lsquo;Innovate for Growth 2027&rsquo; strategic plan, with double-digit growth in revenue, EBITDA and EPS. Performance was driven by balanced contributions from volume and non-volume related activities, supported by disciplined capital allocation. At the same time, we continued to invest for the future.</i></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><i>In 2025, Euronext delivered the first meaningful milestones of its strategic plan. We&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>scaled up our SaaS offering</i></b></span><span><i>&nbsp;and increased our footprint in the Nordics with the acquisition of Admincontrol. We successfully&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>built the first integrated ETF market in Europe.&nbsp;</i></b></span><span><i>This industry-led initiative received strong support from issuers, representing more than 90% of the European ETF Assets under Management, as well as major European brokers. We&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>delivered value-creative M&amp;A</i></b></span><span><i>&nbsp;through the acquisition of Athex Group entirely in shares, in line with Euronext&rsquo;s disciplined investment criteria and our vision of building more integrated European capital markets.</i></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><i>In 2026, we will intensify the execution of our strategic initiatives. In March 2026, we will&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>diversify our commodities franchise with the addition of power futures.</i></b></span><span><i>&nbsp;We will complete our Repo offering to&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>create a truly European Repo market</i></b></span><span><i>&nbsp;by June 2026. In September 2026, Euronext Securities will start to settle cash equities traded in Amsterdam, Brussels and Paris, an important step in&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>becoming the CSD of choice in Europe</i></b></span><span><i>.</i></span></p>
<p align="justify"><span><i>We enter 2026 with confidence and determination. Confidence because we know that we have the right value proposition and talents to further expand our integrated value chain across Europe, and determination because our vision of a united, competitive European capital market has become more relevant than ever. We welcome the ambitious proposals of the European Commission to accelerate the delivery of the&nbsp;</i></span><span><b><i>Savings and Investments Union</i></b></span><span><i>. The proposals align with our ambition to serve as the backbone of deep and integrated European markets and to contribute actively&nbsp;to such a development.&rdquo;</i></span><br /><span><b>2025 financial performance</b></span></p>

</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>In 2025, Euronext&rsquo;s underlying revenue and income was &euro;1,823.2 million, up +12.1% compared to 2024. This resulted from solid organic growth in non-volume related businesses, a dynamic trading environment across asset classes, and the positive contribution of acquisitions. Following the final PPA assessment of Admincontrol, contract liabilities have been adjusted to fair value at the initial recognition. This fair value adjustment was recognised as non-underlying item, reducing reported revenue by &euro;4.4 million, with no impact on cash and cash equivalents.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>On a like-for-like basis and at constant currencies, Euronext consolidated revenue and income was up +9.5% in 2025, at &euro;1,776.6 million, compared to 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Non-volume related revenue accounted for 59% of underlying Group revenue in 2025, stable compared to 2024. This stable split reflects the strong growth in non-volume related revenue and income, underpinned by a dynamic trading environment. Non-volume-related revenue covered 157% of underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A, compared to 156% in 2024.</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><b>2025 adjusted EBITDA</b></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation were at &euro;680.1</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>million, up +9.6%. On a constant perimeter, underlying expenses were in line with the revised guidance of &euro;660 million, and lower than the initial guidance of &euro;670 million. In addition, Euronext recorded &euro;20 million of underlying expenses excluding D&amp;A from acquisitions performed over 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation increased by +5.3% compared to 2024, which highlights the growth investments performed over 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Consequently, adjusted EBITDA for the year totalled &euro;1,143.1 million, up +13.6% compared to 2024. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.7%, up +0.8 points compared to 2024. On a like-for-like basis, adjusted EBITDA for 2025 was up +12.1%, to &euro;1,127.4 million, and adjusted EBITDA margin was 63.5%, up +1.5 points compared to 2024.</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><b>2025 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</b></span><br /><br /></li>

<p align="justify"><span>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;199.9 million in 2025, up +5.9%, resulting from acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;86.9 million and is included in depreciation and amortisation.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>2025 adjusted operating profit was &euro;1,054.0 million, up +14.2% compared to 2024 adjusted operating profit. &euro;125.4 million of non-underlying expenses, including depreciation and amortisation, were reported in 2025, related to acquisitions, integration costs and the PPA of acquired businesses.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Net financing expense for 2025 amounted to &euro;18.3 million, compared to a net financing income of &euro;17.5</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>million in 2024. This decrease resulted from lower net interest income due to decreasing interest rates and new bond issuances with higher financing costs, as well as the non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds issued in May 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Results from equity investments amounted to &euro;35.4 million in 2025, including &euro;24.5 million of dividend received from Euroclear and &euro;10.5 million of dividend from Sicovam. In 2024, Euronext reported &euro;34.7 million of results from equity investments.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Income tax for 2025 was &euro;251.2 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.7% for 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Share of non-controlling interests mainly relating to MTS and Nord Pool amounted to &euro;47.2 million in 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>As a result, the reported net income, share of the parent company shareholders, increased by +9.8% for 2025 compared to 2024, to &euro;642.9 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;6.34 basic and &euro;6.29 diluted in 2025 (considering the convertible bonds under IAS 33), compared to &euro;5.65 basic and &euro;5.63 diluted in 2024. This increase reflects the strong results and a lower number of shares over 2025 compared to 2024 due to the share repurchase programmes performed.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders was up +7.9%to &euro;736.5 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was up +10.3%in 2025, at &euro;7.27 per share, compared to an adjusted EPS (basic) of &euro;6.59 per share in 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>The weighted number of shares used over 2025 was 101,352,825 for the basic calculation and 103,070,023 for the diluted calculation, compared to 103,578,980 and 103,983,870 respectively over 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In 2025, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;812.1 million, compared to &euro;708.6 million in 2024. The difference results from higher profit before tax, higher income tax, and lower negative impact from changes in working capital. Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 75.2% of EBITDA in 2025.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span>Revenue from Custody and Settlement in Q4 2025 was at &euro;76.7 million, +9.6% compared to Q4 2024. This strong performance reflects Euronext&rsquo;s continued growth in assets under custody, resilient settlement activity and double-digit growth of value-added services, as well as the contribution from Athex CSD from 24 November 2025. Assets under custody in Euronext Securities reached &euro;7.6 trillion at the end of the quarter, up +7.7% compared to the end of Q4 2024. Close to 37 million instructions were settled via Euronext Securities during the fourth quarter of 2025, up +9.6% compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Other Post Trade revenue, which includes membership fees and other non-volume-related clearing fees, was &euro;7.2&nbsp;million in Q4 2025. The -6.3% decrease compared to Q4 2024 is mainly explained by the migration of Italian markets to a harmonised clearing framework, offering clients an optimised, efficient and resilient clearing system.</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span>Advanced Data Solutions revenue was &euro;67.0 million in Q4 2025, up +8.1% compared to Q4 2024.

<li><span><b>Q4 2025 adjusted EBITDA</b></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A</span><span>12</span><span>&nbsp;were at &euro;185.8 million (+13.8%). The increase compared to Q4 2024 reflects investments in growth and the impact of acquisitions performed in 2025.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>As a result of the double digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA for the quarter reached &euro;275.0 million, up +8.9% compared to Q4 2025. This represents an adjusted EBITDA margin of 59.7%, -1.0 pts vs. Q4 2024 mostly due to recruitments for the delivery of strategic growth projects and the impact of acquisitions. On a like-for-like basis at constant currencies, adjusted EBITDA grew by +5.5% compared to Q4 2024.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Following the final PPA assessment of Admincontrol, contract liabilities have been adjusted to fair value at the initial recognition. This fair value adjustment was recognised as non-underlying item, reducing reported revenue by &euro;4.4 million (compared to &euro;0.0 million in Q4 2024), with no impact on cash and cash equivalents. Q4 2025 non-underlying operating expenses excluding D&amp;A amounted to &euro;9.8 million, mostly related to the Athex Group transaction and the integration of recent acquisitions. As a consequence, reported EBITDA was at &euro;260.8 million, up +8.1% compared to Q4 2024.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span><b>Q4 2025 net income, share of the parent company shareholders</b></span><br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify"><span>Depreciation and amortisation accounted for &euro;54.2 million in Q4 2025, +9.3% more than Q4 2024. The increase mainly relates to acquisitions. PPA related to acquired businesses accounted for &euro;27.7 million. The ramp up reflects the integration of the PPA for Admincontrol from this quarter. Adjusted operating profit was &euro;253.2 million, up +9.5% compared to Q4 2024. Euronext reported a net financing expense of &euro;4.3 million in Q4 2025, compared to &euro;6.5 million net financing income in Q4 2024. The variation reflects decreasing interest rates and the recognition of non-cash interest expense related to the convertible bonds, partly offset by the benefit of the tender offer and early redemption of a portion of the EUR 2026 bonds. Euronext received &euro;10.9 million of results from equity investments in Q4 2025, mostly reflecting the dividend received from Sicovam.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>Income tax for Q4 2025 was &euro;56.8 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 26.7% for the quarter, compared to 26.6% in Q4 2024. Share of non-controlling interests amounted to &euro;11.7 million, mostly correlated with the resilient performance of MTS and Nord Pool.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>As a result, the reported net income (share of the parent company shareholders) was stable compared to Q4 2024, at &euro;144.7 million. This represents a reported EPS of &euro;1.42 basic and &euro;1.41 diluted. Adjusted net income, share of the parent company shareholders, was up +4.2% to &euro;179.6 million. Adjusted EPS (basic) was &euro;1.77 and adjusted EPS (diluted) was &euro;1.75. The weighted number of shares used over the fourth quarter of 2025 was 101,352,825 for the basic calculation and 103,070,023 (including convertible bonds) for the diluted calculation, compared to 103,578,980 and 103,983,870 respectively over the fourth quarter of 2024. The difference in share count is due to the issuance of shares for the acquisition of Athex Group, the share repurchase programmes executed by Euronext and the consideration of the convertible bonds under IAS 33.</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span>In Q4 2025, Euronext reported a net cash flow from operating activities of &euro;85.5 million, compared to &euro;175.0 million in Q4 2024, mainly reflecting the negative impact of working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities in Q4 2025. Excluding the impact of working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities, net cash flow from operating activities accounted for 60.3% of EBITDA in Q4 2025.</span></p>

With less than 90% of Athex Group&rsquo;s voting rights tendered, Euronext considers all options to achieve this goal and optimise the structure of Athex Group within the Euronext Group. These options include, but are not limited to, the post-offer measures set out in the Information Circular.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) has recorded its first Commercial Paper (CP) listing with the admission of Dangote Cement Plc&rsquo;s Series 1 and Series 2 Commercial Papers under its ₦500 billion Commercial Paper Issuance Programme.</p>
<p>The two series, with a combined value of ₦119.87 billion, were admitted to trading on NGX on 18 February 2026, following the Exchange&rsquo;s introduction of the Commercial Paper listing framework last year.</p>
<p>Dangote Cement&rsquo;s ₦19.95 billion Series 1 Commercial Paper carries a tenor of 181 days and matures on 20 May 2026, while the ₦99.92 billion Series 2 issuance has a tenor of 265 days and will mature on 12 August 2026. Both series were issued at a discount and will be redeemed at par value of ₦1,000 upon maturity. Series 1 and Series 2 Commercial Papers was offered implied yields of 17.50% and 19.00%, respectively.</p>
<p>The Vice Chairman of Highcap Securities Limited, David Adonri, described the development as a sign of growing sophistication in Nigeria&rsquo;s short-term debt market, noting: &ldquo;Dangote Cement&rsquo;s Commercial Paper listing on NGX signals growing sophistication in Nigeria&rsquo;s short-term debt market. The attractive yields of these instruments highlight strong investor appetite for high-quality, short-tenor corporate debt, and provide a benchmark for future issuances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The listing represents a strategic expansion of NGX&rsquo;s product offerings, deepening the Exchange&rsquo;s fixed income market and providing issuers with enhanced visibility, liquidity, and transparency for short-term funding instruments. By admitting Commercial Papers to its platform, NGX is strengthening the efficiency of price discovery while broadening investment options for institutional and qualified investors seeking diversified short-term instruments.</p>
<p>Commercial Papers are unsecured short-term debt instruments issued by corporates to meet working capital and other short-term financing needs. Their admission to trading on the Exchange introduces greater transparency to a market segment that has traditionally operated over-the-counter, while improving secondary market tradability.</p>
<p>The listing of Dangote Cement&rsquo;s CP reflects continued issuer engagement with NGX&rsquo;s platform and supports ongoing efforts to deepen Nigeria&rsquo;s domestic debt capital market. It also reinforces NGX&rsquo;s commitment to innovation, product diversification, and the creation of a more robust, accessible, and globally competitive marketplace.</p>
<p>With this transaction, NGX continues to position itself as a comprehensive capital-raising and trading hub, supporting corporates across the funding spectrum, from equities and bonds to short-term commercial instruments.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Sanctions SBB For Deficiencies In Its Consolidated Financial Statements</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-sanctions-sbb-for-deficiencies-in-its-consolidated-financial-2026218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/finansinspektionen-sanctions-sbb-for-deficiencies-in-its-consolidated-financial-2026218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The deficiencies entailed that the reported consolidated profit for 2021 was too high, the consolidated statement of financial position at the end of the year was incorrect, and certain disclosures were missing.</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p><span>Finansinspektionen (FI) is issuing Samh&auml;llsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB (SBB) a caution and an administrative fine of SEK 80 million for violations of current financial reporting rules regarding how consolidated financial statements are to be prepared.</span></p>
<p><span>The rules regarding periodic financial information are central to ensuring good investor protection and that investors on the stock market and the bond market are able to make well-informed investment decisions. On the bond market, terms and conditions are often linked to loan-to-value ratios and the value of the issuer&rsquo;s assets, which means that matters related to valuations can play a direct role in lenders&rsquo; risk assessments.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;In Europe, the Swedish capital market is viewed as a model. This is something to be proud of and safeguard. It is fundamental that consolidated financial statements provide a fair and accurate view; otherwise, there is a risk that this will undermine confidence in both the stock market and the bond market,&rdquo; says Johan Almenberg, Director General of FI.</span></p>
<p><span>For firms whose assets consist largely of commercial real estate, the valuation principles are also significant for credit assessments more generally. Such properties are widely used as collateral for loan-based financing, and incorrect valuations could lead to an incorrect distribution of loan financing among market participants.</span></p>
<h2>SBB&rsquo;s consolidated financial statements deficient in multiple aspects</h2>
<p><span>FI investigated whether SBB prepared its consolidated financial statements for 2021 in accordance with applicable regulations. The background to the investigation is a review conducted by the Swedish Board for Financial Reporting Supervision, an expert body under the Association for Generally Accepted Principles in the Securities Market.</span></p>
<p><span>The investigation shows that SBB, in its consolidated financial statements for 2021, did not report some properties at their fair value and incorrectly reported two acquisitions as asset acquisitions instead of business combinations. These deficiencies entailed, in part, that the reported consolidated profit before tax for 2021 was SEK 3.6 billion too high and the consolidated statement of financial position at the end of the year was incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;The errors we identified resulted in the presentation of a stronger financial position than what was actually the case. This could have affected the decisions made by investors, including small savers. FI views this seriously,&rdquo; says Jimmy Kvarnstr&ouml;m, Executive Director of Markets at FI.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, the consolidated financial statements did not contain disclosures about the character of the acquisitions in question and their subsequent financial impact.</span></p>
<p><span>FI has therefore decided to issue SBB a caution and an administrative fine of SEK 80 million.</span></p>
<h2>FI&rsquo;s intervention following deficiencies in financial reporting</h2>
<p>FI intervenes when firms subject to the Securities Market Act do not prepare their financial statements in accordance with the rules. First, we issue the firm a caution following the violation of the rules. If FI has issued a caution, the caution can be combined with an administrative fine. FI may also order the firm to make a correction.</p>

<title>​EBA Issues Opinion To the European Commission On The Draft Amended European Sustainability Reporting Standards</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion on the draft amended European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) developed by the European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (EFRAG). The EBA recognises through this Opinion, addressed to the European Commission, the progress achieved in simplifying elements of the initial standards while also highlighting key issues that require further attention - most notably, the permanent nature of certain reliefs.</span></p>
<p>​​The EBA welcomes the progress achieved by EFRAG in streamlining and clarifying several aspects of the initial standards and supports the general approach that aims to reduce the reporting compliance costs.</p>
<p>​​However, the EBA calls for institutions to keep analysing sustainability related risks and recommends&nbsp; time-limits for alleviations in a number of areas. The Opinion focuses on key aspects and concerns related to the proposed reliefs, specially those with a permanent nature, and their possible consequences. In particular, the possible cumulative impact of the overall set of reliefs may significantly reduce the amount of quantitative information reported by undertakings, against one of the objectives expressed by the Commission when opening this review (i.e. prioritise quantitative data) and shift the burden onto users of the information, including banks. The EBA encourages the Commission to consider the issues described in the Opinion before adoption of the amended draft ESRS.</p>
<p>​​Undertakings within the scope of the revised CSRD - typically the largest and best-resourced companies - should be capable of meeting these requirements. The EBA notes that granting such reliefs without an adequate time-limit may undermine the interoperability with international sustainability standards, and would increase the burden on users of the information, such as financial institutions, who may need to resort to the bilateral contact with their counterparties to request information necessary for their risk management.</p>
<p>​​The European Commission also requested an Opinion from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), and the European Central Bank (ECB). ​</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>This Opinion is based on Article 16a(4) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 (&lsquo;EBA founding regulation&rsquo;), which mandates the EBA to issue opinions in its area of competence as requested by the European Commission. In addition, Article 49(3b) of Directive 2013/34/EU (Accounting Directive), as amended by the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), lays down the conditions for the adoption by the European Commission of the delegated acts on the ESRS, including the need to request an opinion, among others, to the EBA.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, EFRAG was requested by the European Commission to deliver a technical advice on how to simplify the delegated act1 on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS &lsquo;Set 1&rsquo;) by November 2025. EFRAG completed this simplification exercise at the end of November and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.efrag.org/en/draft-simplified-esrs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">published</a>&nbsp;the draft amended ESRS on 3 December 2025, after a public consultation period in the summer of 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The draft amended ESRS set out simplified rules and requirements for companies to report on sustainability-related aspects under the Corporate Sustainable Reporting Directive (CSRD).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>EEX Group and Veson Nautical (Veson), a global market leader of maritime data and freight management solutions, today announced an integration between their platforms, with focus on Forward Freight Agreements (FFAs). The collaboration is expected to improve efficiency and enable better capture of mark-to-market values of risk positions for the freight trading communities.</p>
<p>Thanks to the integration, existing and future clients will have the ability to access EEX trade data and price information through&nbsp;<a href="https://veson.com/products/imos/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">IMOS</a>, enabling faster and easier estimation of carbon emissions and carbon costs in the voyage estimator. The flow of EEX data into IMOS also eliminates manual data entry, minimising risk of inaccuracies or duplicate entries.</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We are delighted to enter this partnership, addressing long-standing calls from the trading community. The integration between the platforms will enable improved decision making and result in significant time savings for customers,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;comments Steffen Koehler, CCO at the European Energy Exchange.</p>
<p><em>"The addition of EEX to our&nbsp;<a href="https://veson.com/partner-network/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Platform Partner Network</a>&nbsp;advances our mission to streamline the critical workflows that underpin maritime commerce,&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;says Matt Filosa, VP of Strategy and Operations at Veson Nautical.&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Automated access to EEX pricing and cleared trades not only minimizes operational risk but also strengthens the integrity of the decisions our clients make each day. We&rsquo;re excited to bring this integration to market and to deepen our relationship with EEX in service of our mutual clients."</em></p>
<p>In the frame of the collaboration, the integration of platforms will also create the capabilities for Veson to access European Union Allowance (EUA) Futures trading data for trades that have been concluded through EEX's Touchpoint platform.</p>
<p>Touchpoint is a web-based trade registration platform, aimed at facilitating registration of OTC trades for all EEX markets, including power, natural gas, emissions, dry freight and agricultural asset classes. Touchpoint has been specifically designed to cater to a broad range of users and includes a host of applications and functions which enable greater trading efficiencies for the broking, clearing and trading communities.</p>
<p>IMOS, part of the comprehensive Veson Platform, enables users to manage the evolving complexity of commercial freight contracts&mdash;from pre-fixture chartering and nominations, to voyage operations and cargo visibility, to post-voyage financials and analysis. IMOS puts an end to disparate workflows, unifies systems and stakeholders, and places data precisely in the right context to make a difference in your daily decisions.</p>

<title>Centralis Group Enters U.S. Fund Services Market With Acquisition Of PINE Advisor Solutions - Creates Transatlantic Platform For Alternative Managers Seeking Consistent Governance, Operational Discipline And Regulatory Support</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://centralisgroup.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Centralis Group</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;Centralis&rdquo; or &ldquo;the Group&rdquo;), a leading global alternative asset and corporate services provider, today&nbsp;announced it has acquired&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://pineadvisorsolutions.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PINE Advisor Solutions</a>&nbsp;(&ldquo;PINE&rdquo;), a U.S.-based provider of compliance, fund officer, and distribution services to asset managers. The transaction creates a multijurisdictional, high-touch fund services platform for local and global asset managers.</p>
<p>This transformative transaction extends Centralis&rsquo; reach to the U.S. market and will further strengthen Centralis&rsquo; capabilities in regulatory compliance and fund services as well as accelerate Centralis&rsquo; entry into registered funds, evergreen wrappers and active ETFs.</p>
<p>PINE acts as a distributor for more than $25 billion in ETF assets and provides outsourced chief compliance officer (oCCO) and principal financial officer (oPFO) services for U.S. registered funds. PINE also provides outsourced chief financial officer (oCFO) and regulatory compliance services for private funds and to a growing base of traditional and alternative asset managers. Centralis serves more than 2,000 clients.</p>
<p>Aidan Foley, CEO of Centralis, commented: &ldquo;The PINE team is the perfect partner for us as we pursue our long-term vision. Our complementary businesses and shared commitment to providing clients with high-touch, specialized service make for a strong partnership and will allow us to support PINE and its clients as they navigate a rapidly evolving regulatory environment and abundant growth opportunities. This partnership represents a key milestone in our growth strategy to explore new business lines and jurisdictions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Market dynamics are driving growing demand for specialized fund services. The push to democratize access to alternative investments is bringing new fund structures and distribution channels to market. Continued ETF growth and recent SEC guidance expanding access to ETFs will further accelerate demand for distribution and compliance support, and the growing complexity of the regulatory and technology landscape is making outsourced fund services increasingly valuable to managers.</p>
<p>Derek Mullins, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, PINE Advisor Solutions, said: &ldquo;This partnership is a natural next step for PINE. Our clients will continue to work with the same team and receive the same level of service they've always known from us, now backed by the institutional strength of a global platform, with more resources, deeper expertise, and continued investment in the services they rely on. We're excited about what we can build together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>JB Blue, Co-Founder and Managing Partner, added: &ldquo;What matters most to me is what this means for our clients and our people. Our commitment to putting clients at the center of everything we do only gets stronger with Centralis behind us, and being part of a global platform gives our professionals broader resources and more room to grow their careers."</p>
<p>Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and is expected to close by early Q2 2026.</p>
<p>PWC provided financial and tax support and Dorsey &amp; Whitney provided legal counsel to Centralis.&nbsp;Macquarie Capital served as the financial advisor and DLA Piper provided legal counsel to PINE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<title>ESMA Supports The Simplified European Sustainability Reporting Standards And Suggests Targeted Adjustments</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/esma-supports-the-simplified-european-sustainability-reporting-standards-and-sug-2026218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The European Securities and Markets Authority, the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, has delivered its&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2026-02/ESMA32-846262651-5440_Opinion_on_revised_ESRS.pdf">opinion&nbsp;on the draft revised European Sustainability Reporting Standards</a><span>&nbsp;(ESRS) developed&nbsp;</span><a>by&nbsp;</a><span>EFRAG. ESMA strongly supports the European Commission&rsquo;s goal of enhancing competitiveness and growth through simplification and burden reduction. On this basis, ESMA welcomes EFRAG&rsquo;s proposed changes to the ESRS and finds room for specific modifications.</span></p>
<p><span>The draft changes to the ESRS contain a number of improvements in readability, language and format of the standards as well as in the volume of requirements. Additionally, helpful simplifications have been introduced in several areas, promoting reporting which focuses more on material matters. Nevertheless, ESMA finds that the draft revised ESRS&nbsp;</span><em><span>partly</span></em><span>&nbsp;meet the objective of supporting investor protection and financial stability</span><span>&nbsp;due to certain technical issues which it recommends the Commission to address.</span></p>
<p><span>Verena Ross, Chair, said:</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><em>ESMA supports the aim of achieving simplification and burden reduction for issuers and believes EFRAG&rsquo;s revision of the ESRS is a decisive step in the right direction, even if we see room for some targeted improvements.</em></h4>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><em>In the current Omnibus transition context, and consistent with our previous statements, ESMA and national competent authorities are committed to pragmatic supervision of sustainability reporting. This will reduce unnecessary burden while&nbsp;</em><a>still ensuring that the right information reaches investors and the wider market.</a></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In the interest of investor protection and financial stability, ESMA advises the Commission to make some adjustments to the revised ESRS, namely:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>introduce time limits to certain permanent reliefs,</li>
<li>refine requirements on transition plans,</li>
<li>strengthen reporting on the sustainability competences of administrative, management and supervisory bodies,</li>
<li>enhance transparency on the financial resources allocated to sustainability actions, and</li>
<li>adjust the exemption from reporting sustainability risks and opportunities for subsidiaries excluded from consolidated financial statements due to immateriality.&nbsp;</li>

<ul class="bullet-listing">
<li>
<h5>Reinforcing Euronext&rsquo;s position as a leading venue for international energy companies</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market capitalisation of approximately NOK 5.5 billion</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The fifth listing on Euronext in 2026</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates Gulf Keystone Petroleum (ticker: GKP), an independent oil company, on its listing on Euronext Growth Oslo. The Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs markets continues to prove itself as a natural home for the energy sector following a string of listings over the past year. This is the fifth listing on Euronext so far in 2026.</p>
<p>Gulf Keystone Petroleum&rsquo;s principal asset is the Shaikan oilfield in the Kurdistan region of Iraq, with gross average production of 41,560 barrels of oil per day in 2025. The company is currently listed on the London Stock Exchange and the dual listing on Euronext Growth Oslo is part of Gulf Keystone Petroleum&rsquo;s strategy to increase the liquidity of its issued share capital, attract new institutional and retail shareholders and improve access to capital markets. According to the company, they will later pursue a listing on the main market Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In connection with the listing, Gulf Keystone Petroleum completed a private placement, where the company raised gross proceeds of approximately NOK 11.3 million and welcomed around 700 new shareholders. At market opening today, the price was&nbsp;NOK&nbsp;25.15&nbsp;per share,&nbsp;giving&nbsp;the company a market value of&nbsp;NOK&nbsp;5.5 billion.</p>
<p><span>David Thomas, Non-Executive Chair of Gulf Keystone Petroleum, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em>&ldquo;We are delighted today to complete the dual listing of the company&rsquo;s shares on Euronext Oslo B&oslash;rs and to welcome the circa 700 investors who purchased shares in the retail offering. Oslo&rsquo;s capital markets have long been supportive of Gulf Keystone, primarily through the historic provision of competitive debt financing, and have a deep understanding of the company, the Shaikan oil field and the broader Kurdistan oil and gas industry. In this context, the OSE listing will enable investors active in the Norwegian market with better access to the company&rsquo;s shares and combined with cross-border transfers with our existing listing on the London Stock Exchange, will improve the liquidity of our share capital. We would also like to thank the company&rsquo;s existing shareholders who have been supportive of this strategically important listing initiative.&rdquo;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Tribunal Upholds Bans And Fines For Reckless Adviser And Fund Manager</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-tribunal-upholds-bans-and-fines-for-reckless-adv-2026218/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Upper Tribunal has upheld the FCA's decisions to ban Stephen Joseph Burdett and James Paul Goodchild from working in financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Burdett and Mr Goodchild previously held senior roles at Synergy Wealth Limited (Synergy) and Westbury Private Clients LLP (Westbury), respectively.</p>
<p>The FCA banned the pair from working in regulated financial services for recklessly exposing pension holders to unsuitable investments.</p>
<p>The Tribunal also found that it was appropriate for the FCA to impose penalties of &pound;265,071 on Mr Burdett and &pound;47,600 on Mr Goodchild.</p>
<p>Because of Mr Burdett, 232 personal pension funds worth over &pound;10 million were switched into high-risk investment portfolios that were obviously unsuitable. The portfolios were created and managed by Mr Goodchild at Westbury, with around 38% of overall holdings linked to a single offshore property developer.</p>
<p>Despite his knowledge that the portfolios were high-risk, Mr Burdett allowed Synergy&rsquo;s customers to receive reports indicating that their money would be placed in low or medium risk portfolios. Mr Goodchild included the misleading terms 'cautious' and 'balanced' in the names of 2 of the 3 high-risk portfolios.</p>
<p>In addition, Mr Burdett acted as a director of Synergy despite knowing he did not have the required FCA approval to perform that function. He also failed to co-operate with the FCA&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>The FCA intervened in 2016 to protect consumers, stopping the pensions business of Synergy and Westbury. Both firms subsequently went into liquidation and were dissolved.</p>
<p>To date, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) has paid out over &pound;1.4m to victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'People trusted Mr Burdett and Mr Goodchild with their hard-earned savings and were badly let down. The pair worked together to switch customers' pensions into obviously unsuitable, high-risk investments.</p>
<p>'They made significant personal profits from their actions. We will not tolerate such conduct and are pleased that the Tribunal agrees.'</p>
<p>The Tribunal noted that 'Mr Burdett&rsquo;s actions have shown little regard for the interests of Synergy&rsquo;s clients, pension holders whose pensions were transferred to the Westbury SIPP and were invested in ways which Mr Burdett knew were obviously high risk and hopelessly inappropriate'.</p>
<p>In addition, the Tribunal found that 'As an experienced and qualified investment manager, Mr Goodchild must have known of the risk of putting together for pension holders of varying risk appetites portfolios with any significant levels of concentration of investment into an obviously high risk project... He completely ignored this risk, without regard to the interests of the pension holders'. The Tribunal was not satisfied that Mr Goodchild's 'cursory due diligence &hellip; was even remotely sufficient to constitute reasonable steps to ensure suitability.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The FCA fined Mr Burdett &pound;311,762, which the Tribunal reduced to &pound;265,071. Following the hearing, Mr Burdett provided the Tribunal with evidence of tax he had paid on the financial benefit received, which the Tribunal accepted and deducted from his penalty. &nbsp;</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Disciplinary Committee of Nasdaq Stockholm (the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) has found that Neovici Holding AB (publ) (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) has breached the rules of Nasdaq First North Growth Market (the &ldquo;Rulebook&rdquo;) and therefore ordered the Company to pay a fine of five annual fees, corresponding to an amount of SEK 667,525.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee concludes that the Company has violated Article 17.1 of the EU Market Abuse Regulation and Section 4.1.1 of the Rulebook by issuing a press release on 9 May 2025 regarding a financing and cooperation agreement that was not drafted in a manner that enabled a complete and accurate assessment of the significance of the information. The Disciplinary Committee further concludes that the Company breached Section 4.3.1 and Section 4.5 of the Rulebook by publishing its 2024 annual report too late and by failing to update its financial calendar correctly.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee considers the violations to be serious, and therefore a fine shall be imposed as a sanction. The Disciplinary Committee sets the fine at five annual fees.</p>
<p>The Disciplinary Committee&rsquo;s decision is available at:</p>

<title>SET Partners With Krungsri To Empower SMEs With Carbon Measurement For Sustainable Finance Access</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>SET joins forces with Krungsri to advance the development of a sustainable finance ecosystem, leveraging SETCarbon as a central solution to elevate climate data for the business sector, and empower Thai entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs, to access sustainable finance.</b></li>
<li><b style="font-style: inherit;">This collaboration enables Krungsri's corporate customers to use the SETCarbon system for standardized greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data management, providing critical data for sustainable finance decisions, climate risk assessment, and the development of financial tools to support emissions reduction.</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), in collaboration with Bank of Ayudhya pcl (Krungsri), strengthens support for Thai SMEs to establish a foundation for sustainable growth through systematic development of a sustainable finance ecosystem. Starting upstream with education and understanding of the ESG framework, the partnership supports the use of the SETCarbon platform as a tool for managing and reporting corporate GHG emissions, while promoting the development of transition plans for concrete emissions reduction&mdash;a critical factor in enhancing capabilities and increasing access to sustainable finance in the future.</p>
<p><b>SET Chief Strategy &amp; Finance Officer Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> stated that carbon data has become a foundational infrastructure in driving the transition to a low-carbon economy, as global trade regulations and environmental measures are increasingly embedded into market access conditions and supply chain requirements. At the same time, financial institutions and investors are placing greater emphasis on climate risk management in their capital allocation decisions. Therefore, developing quality data infrastructure that connects to the financial sector is a vital mechanism to strengthen the long-term readiness of Thai businesses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This collaboration with Krungsri will support Thai entrepreneurs, particularly SMEs, which are a crucial part of supply chains, in preparing for increasingly stringent climate regulations and disclosure standards through access to systematic carbon data management tools,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>"The SETCarbon platform not only supports data reporting but also enables the data to be utilized for accessing funding sources and financial support for actual business transition. SET continues to advance technology development to make the system user-friendly and easily accessible. Currently, over 380 organizational accounts are using the platform, with user numbers increasing by more than 30 percent over the past six months, reflecting accelerating market adoption and rising demand for standardized carbon data management tools. Around 85 percent of users are listed companies, while the remaining 15 percent are non-listed organizations. Through this collaboration, SET and Krungsri have implemented the SETCarbon system with the bank's customers, bringing SET's total financial institution partners to three, with prospects for continued expansion of partnerships in the future," Soraphol added.</p>
<p><b>Krungsri Head of SME Banking Group Duangkamol Limpuangthip</b> said that "Krungsri is committed to supporting SME entrepreneurs in making tangible transitions to low-carbon business operations. Recognizing that many entrepreneurs need knowledge and clear practical guidance, we have continuously operated the Krungsri ESG Academy to enhance sustainable finance knowledge and support businesses in effectively developing emissions reduction plans. This year, Krungsri has received support from SET to utilize the SETCarbon platform, enabling entrepreneurs to systematically collect and manage GHG emissions data. This data can be verified and registered according to the Thailand Greenhouse Gas Management Organization (Public Organization) (TGO) standards, enhancing credibility and supporting future access to sustainable finance sources."</p>
<p>"Additionally, Krungsri is ready to provide financial support to entrepreneurs seeking to improve their production processes and services to reduce GHG emissions, through special fixed-rate loans starting as low as 3.5 percent for the first two years, helping to ease cost burdens and enhance liquidity so that businesses can confidently invest in environmental initiatives," Duangkamol said.</p>
<p>This collaboration between SET and Krungsri marks a significant step forward in integrating knowledge, tools, and financial support to enhance the capabilities of Thai entrepreneurs and drive long-term sustainable growth, while paving the way for the development of sustainable financial products and services that more comprehensively meet corporate customers' needs.</p>
<p>Organizations interested in using the SETCarbon system, please contact SET&rsquo;s Sustainability Service Development Department at Tel +66(0) 2009 9844 or +66(0) 2009 9597 for more information. Krungsri corporate customers may contact Krungsri Customer Service Center at Tel +66(0) 2626 2626, Monday to Saturday, 08:00-20:00 hrs., excluding public holidays and bank holidays.</p>

<title>ASIC Commences New Review Of Advice Licensees That Use Lead Generation Services</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-commences-new-review-of-advice-licensees-that-use-lead-generation-services-2026218/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has commenced a new review of advice licensees using lead generation services as part of its ongoing program of work to address practices that inappropriately or unnecessarily encourage consumers to switch their superannuation.</p>
<p>Lead generation is a marketing activity designed to create consumer interest in a product or service, with the goal of persuading consumers to purchase the product or service. These services use a range of marketing techniques to introduce consumers to financial services businesses &ndash; including some businesses that encourage consumers to switch their super.</p>
<p>ASIC is concerned that certain practices associated with some lead generation services in financial advice and superannuation may expose consumers to a risk of significant losses.</p>
<p>To help mitigate risks to consumers, ASIC has commenced a review to identify financial advice businesses that use lead generation services, to understand the nature of these arrangements and where appropriate, take disruptive or enforcement action.</p>
<p>As part of the review, ASIC is publishing a&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/investment-warnings/lead-generation-and-how-it-works">list of known entities</a>&nbsp;involved in lead generation, those acting as referral partners, and advice licensees or corporate authorised representatives that have acquired leads, since 1 July 2024.</p>
<p>To improve transparency for consumers, ASIC will continue to update this list of businesses, websites, authorised representatives, financial advisers and financial services licensees involved in lead generation, acting as referral partners or engaging the services of lead generators throughout the course of this review.</p>
<p><strong>The naming of the entities in this list should not be construed as an indication by ASIC that a contravention of the law has occurred, nor should it be considered a reflection upon any person or entity</strong>.</p>
<p>However, consumers should exercise additional caution when engaging with any business that uses lead generation and exhibits the features listed below, including by hanging up on unsolicited calls when feeling pressured into making a decision.</p>
<p>Financial advisers and advice licensees should carefully consider whether they are able to comply with their legal obligations if engaging with lead generation businesses or undertaking lead generation activities that include these features.</p>
<p>Superannuation trustees should review this list of features and compare it with their own internal data for indications of high-risk superannuation switching conduct.</p>
<p>ASIC warns that lead generators that mislead consumers, utilise high pressure tactics or provide financial services without a licence will risk contravening the law. Licensed persons or entities that engage the services of lead generators acting in this way, share this risk. ASIC is putting participants on notice and will consider taking enforcement action where we detect evidence of contraventions of the law.</p>
<h2>Message for consumers</h2>
<p>Before making important decisions, ASIC encourages consumers to be cautious if someone calls about your super. Consumers may receive a call after clicking on an advertisement on social media, filling out a form on a super comparison website, or without solicitation. Lead generators may offer a free &lsquo;super health check&rsquo; or to find your lost super. These can be sales tactics designed to pressure consumers into switching superannuation &ndash; even when a super fund is performing well. If you are feeling pressured or unsure, you should just hang up.</p>
<p>Consumers should be wary of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being pressured to act immediately</li>
<li>Claims that your existing fund is underperforming</li>
<li>The touting of free superannuation &lsquo;health checks&rsquo; and prizes (often via social media advertisements or websites)</li>
<li>Offers to find and consolidate &lsquo;lost super&rsquo; for free</li>
<li>The involvement of unlicensed people in the advice process</li>
<li>Predominant engagement over the phone with limited client contact with a financial adviser</li>
<li>Poor or no product disclosure</li>
<li>Promises of high or unrealistic returns</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumers can visit&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/protect-your-super-from-pushy-sales-calls">Moneysmart&rsquo;s dedicated webpage</a>&nbsp;for more information on how to protect their super from high-risk sales tactics.

<title>CFTC Chairman Selig: Op-Ed | States Encroach On Prediction Markets - The CFTC, The Legitimate Regulator Of These Financial Instruments, Backs Crypto.com In A Lawsuit Appeal.</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-chairman-selig-op-ed-states-encroach-on-prediction-markets-the-cftc-t-2026218/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission for decades has overseen regulation of prediction markets&mdash;or event contracts, as we refer to them&mdash;that help market participants hedge risk, aggregate information and test hypotheses about future outcomes.</p>
<p>In recent years, states have waged legal attacks on the CFTC&rsquo;s authority to regulate these financial instruments. If they succeed, participants would be barred from access to federally regulated event-contract markets. So it should come as no surprise that the commission is filing a friend-of-the-court brief Tuesday supporting Crypto.com in the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>
<p>Well-known CFTC-registered exchanges used by tens of millions of Americans&mdash;including Kalshi, Polymarket,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/Exit/index.htm?https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/COIN" target="_blank">Coinbase</a>&nbsp;and Crypto.com&mdash;face an onslaught of state-driven litigation across the country, with nearly 50 active cases presenting a range of legal challenges. The most common allegation is that these contracts are a form of gambling and therefore subject to state laws. The CFTC will no longer sit idly by while overzealous state governments undermine the agency&rsquo;s exclusive jurisdiction over these markets by seeking to establish statewide prohibitions on these exciting products.</p>
<p>Event contracts serve legitimate economic functions. They allow businesses and individuals to hedge event-driven risks, enable investors to manage portfolio exposure, and provide the public with information about the outcome of future events. Farmers can manage risk related to temperature changes that may affect crops, and small-business owners can hedge against tax increases or energy-price spikes, to name two examples.</p>
<p>Markets that pay out based on the outcome of real-world events such as these emerged through academic and experimental platforms before moving into the commercial sector. In 1992 the CFTC issued its first official recognition of event contracts by granting relief to the Iowa Electronic Markets, a futures market at the University of Iowa in which traders can buy and sell contracts pegged to events such as presidential elections and corporate earnings. Years later, HedgeStreet, now known as Nadex, became the first marketplace to offer event-driven binary contracts that allowed retail traders to speculate on mortgage rates and gasoline prices.</p>
<p>Under the plain language of the Commodity Exchange Act, event contracts are &ldquo;swaps.&rdquo; They are derivative instruments that allow two parties to speculate on future market conditions without owning the underlying asset. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress expressly granted the CFTC comprehensive authority over any such contract based on a commodity. The statutory definition of &ldquo;commodity&rdquo; is extraordinarily broad and includes practically all goods, articles, services, rights and interests except for onions (due to a history of market manipulation) and movie box-office receipts (because of Hollywood lobbying).</p>
<p>The CEA&rsquo;s text is designed to account for financial innovation. Futures were novel at one point. So were swaps and exchange-traded funds. Even as derivatives markets have developed and grown, Congress has chosen to vest the CFTC with broad jurisdiction. That a derivative is novel or different is no excuse for a court to rewrite existing law. The CFTC has been overseeing the integrity of these markets the whole time, ensuring its rules remain durable and flexible in the face of rapid transformation.</p>
<p>The public also benefits from these markets. For anyone tracking prediction markets ahead of the 2024 presidential election, the scale of President Trump&rsquo;s victory was hardly unexpected. It&rsquo;s clear that Americans like the product and want to participate. Noting the exponential growth of transactions in the last two years, one recent industry report estimates the global number of users has quadrupled to 15 million.</p>
<p>Like all markets under the CFTC&rsquo;s exclusive jurisdiction, event-contracts markets are subject to rules and regulations that ensure fair outcomes for market participants. Trading exchanges are required to conduct market surveillance to safeguard against fraud and manipulation. Bank Secrecy Act rules also apply, meaning that CFTC-registered entities must collect customer information to enforce anti-money-laundering measures and prevent insider trading.</p>
<p>These exchanges aren&rsquo;t the Wild West, as some critics claim, but self-regulatory organizations that are examined and supervised by experienced CFTC staff.</p>
<p>America is home to the most liquid and vibrant financial markets in the world because our regulators take seriously their obligation to police fraud and institute appropriate investor safeguards. Any erosion of the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to regulate transactions in commodity derivatives is a direct threat to the markets and investors Congress intended the agency to oversee.</p>

<title>Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Releases Annual Compliance Report 2026 To Help Dealers Meet Regulatory Requirements And Advance Investor Protection - Report Sheds Light On Common Compliance Challenges And How Dealers Can Address Them</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-releases-annual-compliance-report-20-2026218/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-releases-annual-compliance-report-20-2026218/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) published its Annual Compliance Report, providing insight for dealers into emerging compliance challenges and how they can address them. CIRO&rsquo;s Annual Compliance Report helps dealers focus their supervision and risk-management efforts to comply with CIRO&rsquo;s regulatory requirements effectively while reflecting the realities of their individual business models.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CIRO&rsquo;s Compliance Report helps dealers understand industry-wide trends in compliance matters so they can adapt their policies and procedures to meet emerging challenges and better protect investors from potential harm,&rdquo; said Andrew J. Kriegler, President and CEO of CIRO. &ldquo;As dealers continue to adopt innovative technologies and evolve their operations to meet the changing needs of Canadian investors, mitigating new risks is crucial to maintain the integrity and health of Canadian capital markets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><em>Managing the risks of emerging technologies while supporting innovation</em></h2>
<p>How dealers can effectively innovate while managing the risks of emerging technologies to protect investors was once again a key theme of this year&rsquo;s report. Highlights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Cybersecurity</span>&nbsp;remains a key business risk. As we shared in August 2025, CIRO experienced firsthand a sophisticated cyber attack, which has become increasingly common. While the report warns of an increase in cybersecurity incident reports involving third-party service providers that have affected dealers, it also notes that substantial progress has been made in the remediation of cybersecurity-related findings. As personnel are the most valuable asset in managing cybersecurity risk, the report emphasizes the need for continuous training for all staff to enhance awareness and reduce vulnerability to attacks.</li>
<li><span>Crypto Asset Trading Platforms (CTPs)</span>&nbsp;continue to be onboarded into CIRO membership. On February 3, 2026, CIRO published&nbsp;<em>Guidance Note 26-0033: Notice on CIRO's Digital Assets Custody Framework</em>&nbsp;to support a framework for standardized crypto custody arrangements and segregation requirements. CIRO is also helping CTPs respond to evolving market and technology needs through InnovateSafe, a regulatory sandbox initiative that allows CIRO-regulated firms to safely test innovative products and technologies in a controlled environment with CIRO oversight.</li>
<li><span>Artificial intelligence (AI)</span>&nbsp;is becoming increasingly important in enabling dealers to manage complexity, improve efficiency, and strengthen decision-making. The report notes that CIRO will be inquiring about the use of AI in dealers&rsquo; operations and reviewing the operational controls implemented to ensure AI is working as designed as part of its Financial and Operations compliance examinations.</li>
</ul>
<h2><em>Helping dealers maintain strong compliance frameworks</em></h2>
<p>The report encourages dealers to review the findings from the recent CSA-CIRO Client Focused Reforms (CFR) Phase 2 Sweep, which evaluated the implementation of CFR enhancements associated with Know Your Client (KYC) information collection, Product Due Diligence (PDD), Know Your Product (KYP) and Suitability Assessments. The most common deficiency identified for CIRO dealers was a failure to have policies and procedures that are tailored to the firm&rsquo;s business model and are detailed and actionable.</p>
<p>In addition, the report summarizes several notable observations made by CIRO Compliance teams during their recent examinations that may impact the effectiveness of dealers&rsquo; compliance systems. Common issues identified include:</p>
<ul>
<li>gaps in supervisory practices, including inadequate review of outside activities and insufficient identification of client communications through non-approved channels.</li>
<li>gaps in how dealers identify, assess and disclose conflicts of interest.</li>
<li>concerns about the adequacy of daily and monthly trade supervision systems.</li>
<li>deficiencies in controls over referral arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report encourages dealers to review their policies, procedures and practices considering these findings to maintain strong compliance frameworks.</p>
<h2><em>Ensuring compliance with registration and proficiency requirements</em></h2>
<p>The report also provides an update on the delegation of registration functions to CIRO, noting that CIRO now handles the registration function for the majority of individuals who work in Canada&rsquo;s securities industry. Dealers are reminded to submit complete registration information to CIRO in order to ensure timely decisions. Investment dealers should also ensure their approved persons are aware of CIRO&rsquo;s new assessment-centric proficiency model and implement policies and procedures to ensure timely completion and reporting of training requirements.</p>

<title>CFTC Reaffirms Exclusive Jurisdiction Over Prediction Markets In U.S. Circuit Court Filing</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-reaffirms-exclusive-jurisdiction-over-prediction-markets-in-us-circuit-co-2026218/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission today filed an amicus brief in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit confirming its exclusive jurisdiction over the U.S. commodity derivatives markets, including event contract markets commonly referred to as prediction markets. The brief was filed in&nbsp;<em>North American Derivatives Exchange, Inc. et al v. The State of Nevada on relation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board et al</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CFTC-registered exchanges have faced an onslaught of lawsuits seeking to limit Americans&rsquo; access to event contracts and undermine the CFTC&rsquo;s sole regulatory jurisdiction over prediction markets. This power grab ignores the law and decades of precedent,&rdquo; said CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig. &ldquo;Event contracts allow businesses and individuals to hedge event-driven risks, enable investors to manage portfolio exposure, and provide the public with information about the outcome of future events. These products are commodity derivatives and squarely within the CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory remit. As I&rsquo;ve said before, the CFTC has the expertise and responsibility to defend its exclusive jurisdiction over commodity derivatives, and that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The amicus brief outlines the legal history of the CFTC&rsquo;s exclusive jurisdiction over all commodity derivatives markets, including prediction markets. Over the years, courts and Congress have established and affirmed the CFTC&rsquo;s role in regulating these markets. States and other federal entities do not have the authority to further regulate markets within the CFTC&rsquo;s exclusive jurisdiction, and attempting to do so would have destabilizing economic effects.</p>
<p>The CFTC first officially recognized event contracts in 1992 when it allowed the Iowa Electronic Markets, a futures market at the University of Iowa in which traders can buy and sell contracts pegged to events such as presidential elections and corporate earnings. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, Congress expressly granted the CFTC comprehensive authority over any such contract based on a commodity, which is broadly defined in statute. The Commodity Exchange Act is designed to account for innovation in the financial markets, allowing for new and emerging use cases within CFTC-regulated markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Temi Popoola, Group Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of Nigerian Exchange Group, has called for continued collaboration among regulators, exchanges, and international partners to effectively channel sustainable capital flows across emerging markets.</span><br /><br /><span>Speaking at the International Finance Corporation conference in Cairo during a panel session themed Capital Mobilization for Sustainability, Transition and Resilience, Popoola provided insights into the evolving landscape for developing economies.</span><br /><br /><span>He acknowledged that emerging markets are navigating structural considerations, including the development of ESG data and reporting infrastructure, policy frameworks, funding costs, and market liquidity. He also noted a growing global investor appetite for sustainable assets, supported by innovation in labelled instruments and the ongoing enhancement of regulatory standards.</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Emerging markets have a significant opportunity to contribute to the future of sustainable capital flows,&rdquo; Popoola said. &ldquo;Realizing this potential calls for constructive alignment, robust disclosure standards, policy consistency, and synergy across the capital market ecosystem.&rdquo; He highlighted the importance of evolving disclosure frameworks, noting that stronger reporting standards can enhance transparency, support risk assessment, and help attract long-term investment.</span><br /><br /><span>Drawing on Nigeria&rsquo;s experience, he pointed to the country's green and sustainable bond market, which began with Africa&rsquo;s first certified sovereign green bond in 2017. Since then, the market has expanded across sovereign, sub-national, and corporate issuers, with repeated oversubscription reflecting growing investor confidence. He also referenced Nigeria&rsquo;s sovereign sukuk programme, including the most recent Series VII Sukuk, which recorded subscriptions significantly above the offer size, demonstrating sustained domestic demand for long-term infrastructure-linked instruments.</span><br /><br /><span>According to Popoola, stock exchanges play a key role in advancing sustainable finance by providing platforms for impact-focused instruments, supporting disclosure standards, and aiding issuer capacity building. In this regard, he highlighted NGX&rsquo;s Impact Board, launched in 2024 as a dedicated listing segment for green, social, and sustainability-linked instruments. He also discussed the NGX Net-Zero Programme, co-funded by DEG Impulse, which supports listed companies in developing science based transition plans and enhancing climate disclosures. The programme is projected to reduce or avoid approximately 20,000 tonnes of CO₂e emissions in its initial phase while positioning companies to access climate-aligned financing.</span><br /><br /><span>On collaboration, Popoola emphasized the importance of alignment among policymakers and market operators, citing Nigeria&rsquo;s first sovereign green bond, executed through coordination between the Exchange, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Environment and the Debt Management Office, as an example of effective public, private partnership.</span><br /><br /><span>The conference convened policymakers, regulators, exchange leaders, and development finance institutions to explore pathways for mobilizing capital toward sustainability, resilience, and long-term economic growth across emerging markets.</span></p>

<title>What Will Artificial Intelligence Mean For The Labor Market And The Economy? Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr, At The New York Association For Business Economics, New York, New York</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/what-will-artificial-intelligence-mean-for-the-labor-market-and-the-economy-fed-2026217/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Before I get into my main topic, I wanted to share my current views on the economy and monetary policy.</p>
<p>Last week, we received the latest report on employment, and it provided further evidence that while the labor market slowed through last summer, it is now stabilizing. This stabilization is occurring with an unemployment rate that is broadly consistent with what many estimate is its long-run level, when the economy is in balance. That said, job creation has been near zero over the course of last year, as has labor force growth. With very low levels of job creation and also a low firing rate, there seems to be a tentative balance in labor supply and demand. But it is a delicate balance, and that means that the labor market could be especially vulnerable to negative shocks.</p>
<p>Turning to the other component of our mandate, inflation based on personal consumption expenditures remains elevated at 3 percent, about where it was a year ago. Disinflation, which started in mid-2022, slowed last year, as goods price inflation picked up, in large part due to tariffs. That pattern appeared to continue in the inflation data released last week. Looking ahead, it is reasonable to forecast that tariff effects on inflation will begin to abate later this year, but there are many reasons to be concerned that inflation will remain elevated. I see the risk of persistent inflation above our 2 percent target as significant, which means we need to remain vigilant.</p>
<p>The prudent course for monetary policy right now is to take the time necessary to assess conditions as they evolve. I would like to see evidence that goods price inflation is sustainably retreating before considering reducing the policy rate further, provided labor market conditions remain stable. Based on current conditions and the data in hand, it will likely be appropriate to hold rates steady for some time as we assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.</p>
<p>I'll now turn to my main topic today.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI)&mdash;and by this, I mean in particular the recent explosive growth of generative AI&mdash;looks increasing likely to become what technologists call a general-purpose technology. General-purpose technologies such as the steam engine, electricity, and personal computers are characterized by widespread adoption, continual improvement, and a cascade of downstream innovations in new goods or services, production processes, and business structures.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>In addition to the likelihood that AI becomes a general-purpose technology, it may also become an "invention in the method of invention," something that increases the efficiency of research and development (R&amp;D) and thus drives further innovation and the attendant benefits. Personal computers qualify here because their widespread adoption, continuous improvement, and many applications over the past 50 years or so exponentially expanded our ability to invent things. And in the same way that computers were used to fundamentally improve the process of discovery in, for example, medicine, engineering, and physical sciences, generative AI and earlier forms of AI such as machine learning applications are already being used in R&amp;D and yielding discoveries in domains such as drug discovery and materials science.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>Periods of rapid technological change are often accompanied by anxiety about the economic and social consequences of automation. Although new technologies often create winners and losers in the short run, history shows that in the longer run innovation leads to broadly shared increases in productivity and living standards that tend to support economic growth and a healthy labor market. As with other general-purpose technologies, the long-run effects of AI are likely to be profoundly positive. But in the short term, AI may deeply disrupt labor markets and harm some workers. The ultimate impact on workers will depend not only on the extent of the disruption and the length of time it takes for the long-term benefits to appear, but importantly on how we, as a society, navigate this transition.</p>
<p>In the past, the type of work that was most amenable to automation, whether by machines or computer software, were routine tasks that followed explicit, codifiable rules&mdash;rules that were written by people. AI models, on the other hand, learn by example: An AI model doesn't need to be told exactly how to accomplish a certain task, only provided with the right training data to infer patterns. Consequently, AI can learn how to complete complex, nonroutine tasks that require knowledge that is difficult or impossible for humans to codify.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Unlike a robot that follows necessarily human instructions to, say, bolt on a car fender over and over, this ability to implement complex tasks could vastly expand the set of tasks that AI is potentially capable of performing. That is especially true if one considers the integration of AI with other technologies such as robots, or cars. Moreover, agentic AI can accomplish more general goals with limited human supervision, mimicking human decision-making, reasoning, and implementation. Many economically valuable tasks can (or may soon) be feasible using AI.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p><span>Developments in AI Adoption</span><br />The capabilities of GenAI models have improved rapidly. In just a few years, we have seen AI models meet or surpass human performance on increasingly challenging benchmarks, including competition-level mathematics and Ph.D.-level science questions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Real-world applications abound. AI is already changing the speed of pharmaceutical drug discoveries, the efficiency of customer service, and the pace of computer coding, especially by the biggest tech firms themselves.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>The speed of AI adoption may be much faster than previous general-purpose technologies, boosting productivity growth, but also allowing less time for workers, businesses, and the economy to adapt to these changes.</p>
<p>As of December 2025, 17 percent of businesses in the U.S. Census Business Trends and Outlook Survey (BTOS) report using AI in their business functions. While that may seem modest on the surface, the share is much higher among large firms and in tech-intensive sectors like information, finance and insurance, and professional and technical services. In the BTOS, about 30 percent of businesses with more than 250 employees report using AI. A recent survey of mostly large firms by McKinsey found that 88 percent report that AI has been used in at least one business function.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;The share using generative AI specifically rose from 33 percent in 2023 to 79 percent in 2025.</p>
<p>Adoption of generative AI among both individuals and businesses has been very fast by historical standards. A 2024 St. Louis Fed paper estimates that generative AI adoption in the workplace following the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 was as fast as workplace computer adoption after the release of the IBM PC in 1984.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Actual use of generative AI in the workplace may be even higher than reported by businesses since there is some evidence of workers using AI tools without their manager's knowledge.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a></p>
<p>That said, the depth of AI adoption at this point remains unclear. McKinsey found that most businesses using AI remain in the experimentation or piloting phases of adoption. Some firms that have experimented with AI abandoned these trials.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Like previous technology breakthroughs, effective use of AI will likely require fundamental changes in business practices and organization. Workers have to be retrained. Managers have to develop best practices. And obtaining the full range of productivity enhancements from new technology may require costly experimentation and further innovation. The productivity gains from electrification in the early 20th century reflected not only how factories were powered but also changes in how they were designed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This process took decades to play out. Within firms, there is evidence from the manufacturing sector that productivity follows a J-shape after technology adoption: adjustment costs lead to short-run losses before firms that ride it out are able to realize larger, longer-run gains.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Within the Federal Reserve System, we have also been exploring the use of AI in our own operations and have established an AI program and governance framework for the use of AI technologies. One internal application of GenAI that shows considerable promise is technology modernization. Within clear guardrails, we are using GenAI tools to translate legacy code, generate unit tests, and accelerate cloud migration. So far, the result of this usage is faster delivery, improved quality, and an enhanced developer experience. In one recent project updating hundreds of databases, AI tools helped cut the time to complete this type of work by 50 percent, detected and resolved 30 percent more issues during testing compared to previous migrations, and enhanced team focus on higher-value coding work. My sense is that these are the kinds of uses and the scale of success that many businesses are experiencing.</p>
<p><span>Implications for the Labor Market</span><br />Predictions about how generative AI will evolve, and in particular how it will affect the labor market, range from the utopian to the apocalyptic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In previous speeches, I have outlined a couple of scenarios as a way to think through the potential effects of AI on the economy, including the labor market.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;But as is the case for AI's technological advances, the debate about the possible effects of AI evolves quickly, so I will briefly revisit these scenarios and then discuss how new research is starting to bring the initial and potential labor market effects of AI into focus.</p>
<p><em>Scenario of gradual adoption</em><br />Under a first scenario, AI proceeds like other general-purpose technologies, perhaps diffusing a bit faster. This leads to strong productivity growth, comparable to what we saw in the late 1990s and early 2000s, or maybe even stronger than that. As was the case during earlier technological advances, some occupations are displaced while new ones emerge, as AI is increasingly integrated into many existing roles. But AI adoption occurs gradually enough that large and widespread joblessness is avoided. Unemployment might rise somewhat in the short term due to skill mismatch, but education and training choices adjust over time, and many workers successfully retrain and retain their jobs or find new ones. With strong productivity growth, the economy can sustain faster output growth and real wages rise.</p>
<p><em>Scenario of rapid growth in AI capabilities and adoption</em><br />Under a second scenario, AI capabilities grow exponentially and adoption is extremely rapid, ushering in a "jobless boom." AI agents replace or displace a range of professional and service occupations. Autonomous vehicles and robotics automate many manufacturing and transportation jobs, with labor increasingly concentrated in a few manual or highly skilled trades, or in roles where consumers put a premium on human interaction. AI-centric start-ups with radically new business models displace firms that are unable to adapt, and layoffs soar, leading to widespread unemployment in the short run and declines in labor force participation over time, as a large share of the population is essentially unemployable. It is understandable why many people would fear such a future, and it would present profound social and distributional challenges. With a vastly more productive economy, but much less demand for labor, society would have to rethink the social safety net to ensure that the gains from unprecedented economic growth are shared rather than concentrated among a small group of capital holders and AI superstars. And there would need to be profound changes in education, training, and workforce development. We should be clear-eyed about how painful these changes could be for affected workers and how challenging it would be for the government and the private sector to successfully manage the fallout.</p>
<p>One thing that these two scenarios have in common is that AI's initial promise is borne out, and it transforms the economy&mdash;either gradually and in a more manageable way, or abruptly and to a much greater extent.</p>
<p><em>Scenario of stalled growth in AI capabilities and adoption</em><br />A third option is that improvements in AI capabilities stall, perhaps owing to the exhaustion of training data, a shortage of electricity supply or distribution to satisfy the huge demands of data centers, or shortages of the capital required to build all this new infrastructure.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;One estimate is that AI investment will require the issuance of $1 trillion in new debt over the next five years, and other estimates are even higher. With questions about whether demand will grow sufficiently to utilize this investment, some have drawn comparisons to the overinvestment in the dot-com era.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;Timing mismatches in the investment and business integration process could lead to reduced realization of the potential of AI.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;The hard work of business process transformation takes time, which partly accounts for the J curve dynamics I mentioned earlier. Businesses that do not see immediate productivity improvements may lose interest. In a scenario of stalled growth in AI capabilities and adoption, some productivity improvements occur in easy-to-learn tasks, but AI proves incapable of completing hard-to-learn tasks or complex projects, or an AI bust occurs, abruptly ending needed investment. As a result, any boost that AI provides to aggregate productivity growth is modest and fades over time.</p>
<p>It is possible that in this scenario, AI still ends up widely adopted. As is the case for social media or smartphones, AI applications may still generate significant value for consumers and many businesses. In the workplace, it might look much like email or search engines do now&mdash;tools that are ubiquitous, even indispensable, but not necessarily revolutionary by themselves. In a scenario where AI disappoints, the balance of risks shifts from the labor market to the financial sector. When anticipated demand falls short, the risk of financial stress increases, as happened following the expansion of the U.S. railroad network in the late 19th century.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;More recently, we saw these dynamics play out in a more limited way with the overbuilding of fiber optic telecommunications in the early 2000s, which contributed to stress in bond markets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn20" title="footnote 20"><span>20</span></a><a name="f20"></a></p>
<p>Of course, these are stylized scenarios, and facts on the ground may play out differently. Or different scenarios might come to pass in different sectors of the economy in different ways and at different speeds. But a scenario-based approach helps ground our thinking about these potential outcomes.</p>
<p><span>What Have We Learned about the Effects of AI So Far?</span><br />In judging the prospects for the range of outcomes reflected in these scenarios, or other plausible scenarios, we can start with what we have learned about the effects of AI so far. Of course, ChatGPT was released only a bit over three years ago, and we are still in the very early stages of generative AI diffusion. So far, however, research seems to be more consistent with scenario 1: AI as a normal early-stage general-purpose technology, though that doesn't necessarily rule out more extreme scenarios going forward.</p>
<p><em>Productivity</em><br />Let me focus on several aspects of the early economic effects of AI, starting with productivity. We have been in a period of elevated productivity growth for the past five years. This period of higher productivity growth began with the pandemic and the ensuing tight labor market, which led to investment in labor-saving technologies. Moreover, new business formation surged and has remained strong. New businesses that survive tend to be more productive than incumbents, and competition from new businesses spurs innovation among incumbents as well. While it is possible that AI has contributed to this strength more recently, GenAI has had relatively modest penetration thus far.</p>
<p>Yet AI is very likely to have a profound positive impact on productivity growth in the long term. At the microlevel, there is increasing evidence that access to AI assistants improves worker efficiency, speed, and accuracy at various tasks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn21" title="footnote 21"><span>21</span></a><a name="f21"></a>&nbsp;Aggregating the aforementioned task-level evidence, one recent study estimated that AI could contribute between 0.3 and 0.9 of a percentage point to annual total factor productivity growth over the next decade.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn22" title="footnote 22"><span>22</span></a><a name="f22"></a>&nbsp;The upper end of these estimates would make the productivity gains of AI comparable to those of internet communications technologies in the late 1990s, a period of strong productivity growth. Other studies point to much smaller or larger gains, underscoring how dependent these projections are on assumptions about the speed of technological progress and adoption of AI by businesses.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn23" title="footnote 23"><span>23</span></a><a name="f23"></a></p>
<p>But the forms these innovations will take and how long the benefits will take to accrue is hard to say. In 1987, for example, the economist Robert Solow famously quipped, "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics." As it turned out, firms had to learn how to integrate this technology into their business practices in order to fully realize the economic potential of personal computing.</p>
<p>Of course, AI may also contribute to productivity growth not just by improving the efficiency of existing tasks, but also by increasing the efficiency of R&amp;D. The potential of AI to boost the rate of innovation&mdash;to be an invention in the method of invention&mdash;is where we could see even greater economic benefits, though they may take some time to materialize.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn24" title="footnote 24"><span>24</span></a><a name="f24"></a></p>
<p><em>Employment</em><br />So far, the literature suggests that while AI has yet to have a substantial effect on&nbsp;<em>aggregate</em>&nbsp;employment or unemployment, it may be starting to adversely affect some groups, in particular young people who are just starting their careers in some sectors. On balance, this evidence so far is consistent with what we might expect under the gradual adoption scenario I previously described. One study uses data from the payroll provider ADP and finds that early-career workers in occupations highly exposed to AI&mdash;such as software developers and customer service representatives&mdash;have experienced a decline in employment relative to other early-career workers in less exposed fields and experienced workers in the same line of work.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn25" title="footnote 25"><span>25</span></a><a name="f25"></a>&nbsp;Some other research reaches a similar conclusion using resume and job-posting data.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn26" title="footnote 26"><span>26</span></a><a name="f26"></a>&nbsp;The long-run consequences of AI for recent cohorts of young workers is uncertain, but research shows that entering a weak labor market can have persistently adverse effects on workers' earnings. So, for these workers, the short run may have long-term consequences.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn27" title="footnote 27"><span>27</span></a><a name="f27"></a></p>
<p>More broadly, rather than laying off workers, there is evidence that AI adoption is so far leading to re-allocation within firms. One paper finds that although AI does substitute for labor at the task level, overall employment effects are small, as workers shift their time to complementary tasks and firms expand employment elsewhere.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn28" title="footnote 28"><span>28</span></a><a name="f28"></a>&nbsp;Consistent with this internal re-allocation, a recent survey by the New York Fed found that while some firms using AI did report reduced hiring plans and limited layoffs, a much larger share plan to retrain their existing workforce.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn29" title="footnote 29"><span>29</span></a><a name="f29"></a></p>
<p>At the same time, we should be prepared for the possibility that there might be serious short-term disruptions in the labor market, even if the long-term gains to society could be quite favorable. The extent of disruption will depend in part on whether society undertakes the investments needed in new job creation, worker training, connecting workers to new jobs, and other efforts to mitigate adverse labor market effects. The historical record on meaningful efforts to help workers in such a transition is not encouraging.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn30" title="footnote 30"><span>30</span></a><a name="f30"></a>&nbsp;In my judgement, now is the time for society to begin to consider how to address these potential disruptions, while AI adoption is in its early stages.</p>
<p><em>Income and Inequality</em><br />As with employment, there is little evidence that AI has had a meaningful impact on wage growth or the distribution of income gains, at least so far. Going forward, the effect of AI on wages and the distribution of income will depend on factors including whether AI complements or substitutes expertise within jobs that continue to exist, how AI changes relative demand for high-wage occupations, and who owns AI capital. On the one hand, research evaluating the effect of AI assistants in the workplace tends to find the largest productivity gains among the least-experienced workers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn31" title="footnote 31"><span>31</span></a><a name="f31"></a>&nbsp;This suggests that AI could narrow gaps in productivity and wages. If AI facilitates worker learning, as some studies suggest, it might also help displaced workers to re-skill for new jobs, reducing the cost of job dislocation. On the other hand, recent research finds that GenAI is more commonly used by younger, highly educated, and high-income individuals.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn32" title="footnote 32"><span>32</span></a><a name="f32"></a>&nbsp;If high earners are better positioned to take advantage of AI, we could see wage inequality rise as the most productive workers pull even further ahead of their peers.</p>
<p>AI can also affect the wage structure by shifting demand for different occupations. Whereas technological progress has historically favored occupations with higher wages and education requirements, one paper shows that AI has the potential to reverse this pattern, automating higher-paying information-based jobs while increasing relative demand for lower-paying jobs and those requiring less education, thus reducing aggregate wage inequality.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#fn33" title="footnote 33"><span>33</span></a><a name="f33"></a></p>
<p>As with our discussion of labor market disruptions, the effects of AI on inequality will depend in part on whether society undertakes the investments needed to mitigate adverse labor market effects. It is incumbent on us to begin thinking about these important questions now.</p>
<p><span>Implications of AI for Monetary Policy</span><br />I am also thinking about the implications of AI for monetary policy. If AI causes a large and long-lasting dislocation of workers, permanently reducing demand for many kinds of jobs, it could imply higher rates of unemployment, even when the economy is healthy and operating close to its potential. Monetary policy is able to address cyclical conditions, like a downturn in the business cycle, but it cannot address the structural factors that determine the long-run rates of employment. While monetary policy is not suited to dealing with structural changes in the economy, it could be difficult for policymakers to assess in real time whether changes are structural or cyclical. Moreover, some components of the labor market may face structural changes, while others may not. As I noted earlier, it will be important for society to deal with the consequences of any structural changes in the economy because of AI, and policies beyond the purview of the central bank would certainly be needed to address a structural rise in the natural rate of unemployment. As a central banker, I see endeavoring to understand how AI is evolving and affecting labor markets as a crucial component of our work in the years ahead. I have noted that my base case foresees labor market disruptions as relatively short term, even if painful. Over the long term, the labor market would adjust in ways that create new jobs and augment the productivity of existing jobs, boosting real wages. But closely monitoring these developments and adapting, as needed, will be crucial.</p>
<p>In the event that GenAI results in a long-lasting boost to productivity growth, wages and economic activity could grow more than would otherwise be the case without putting upward pressure on inflation. At the same time, demand for capital would rise because of the strong business investment required to take advantage of the technology, putting upward pressures on interest rates, and household savings could fall due to expectations of stronger real wage growth and thus higher lifetime earnings, also putting upward pressure on interest rates. All of this would imply a higher setting for the policy rate when the economy is at equilibrium, or what monetary economists call r*. Indeed, last year I raised my long-term estimate of r* modestly because of higher productivity. Moreover, in the short term, investment in AI could be inflationary&mdash;for example, if electricity supply constraints from inefficiencies in the power grid collide with strong energy demand from the building of data centers. For all of these reasons, I expect that the AI boom is unlikely to be a reason for lowering policy rates.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />In conclusion, I expect that AI will have a transformative effect on the economy and affect a large share of workers in ways that will challenge the ability of the private and public sectors to accommodate this adjustment. In the longer run, I expect AI will boost productivity and living standards, and it may even lead to new discoveries. Society will need to be nimble and bold to reduce the pain of short-term dislocations for workers and to ensure that the benefits are broadly shared. Widespread AI adoption will very likely lead to dramatic and sometimes difficult changes in the way many of us work and live, but the long-term benefits could be even more dramatic.</p>

<p><a name="fn18"></a>18. One warning sign that the speed of adoption may not match the speed of AI infrastructure deployment is in what some firms are reporting about the depreciation of their investments. While computer chips have historically been depreciated over three years, some firms have stretched the depreciation of AI chips to five years or more in their disclosures to shareholders.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#f18"></a></p>

In the early 1890s, bankruptcies at a number of prominent railroads, as well as businesses connected directly and indirectly to the railroads, contributed to a deterioration in the quality of bank loan portfolios.  While this was not the trigger of the Panic of 1893, it was part of the backdrop that made the economy and the banking system more vulnerable; see Mark Carlson (2013), "Panic of 1893," in Randall E. Parker and Robert Whaples, eds.,&nbsp;<em>Routledge Handbook of Major Events in Economic History</em>&nbsp;(London: Routledge), pp. 40&ndash;49.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20260217a.htm#f19"></a></p>

According to Lenain and Paltridge, "Several large firms&mdash;including Worldcom and Global Crossing&mdash;filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 in the United States and AT&amp;T Canada undertook a similar proceeding.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today requested comment on a proposal to&nbsp;establish&nbsp;revised procedures and policies for appeals by OCC-supervised entities of material supervisory determinations.</p>
<p>The proposed changes reflect the OCC&rsquo;s experience administering the bank appeals process and are intended to enhance the independence and efficiency of the appeals function.</p>
<p>The proposal would make several changes to the current appeals process, including adding an &ldquo;appeals board&rdquo; to hear bank appeals, enhancing the role of the Ombudsman as a neutral liaison to help banks seek redress for grievances, establishing a de novo standard of review for appeals, and strengthening prohibitions against retaliation.</p>
<p>Comments on the attached proposal are due 60 days after the date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Publishes Analysis Of Synthetic Risk Transfers</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-publishes-analysis-of-synthetic-risk-transfers-2026217/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The economic importance of synthetic risk transfer (SRT) markets has grown rapidly over the last decade.</li>
<li>Compared with securitisations before the Great Financial Crisis (GFC), SRTs in use recently appear to be more prudently structured and managed.</li>
<li>Risks associated with SRT use merit continued monitoring by supervisors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d607.htm"><span class="firstword">report</span>&nbsp;on synthetic risk transfer</a>&nbsp;(SRT) transactions. The economic importance of SRT markets has grown rapidly over the last decade and they have become an important source of capital relief for corporate credit risk.</p>
<p>SRT transactions involve transferring all or a portion of the credit risk of a pool of assets to a counterparty while the bank retains ownership of the underlying assets. The investor base in SRTs is dominated by private investment funds, although public sector entities also play an important role in some jurisdictions. Capital and credit risk management are the main motivations for banks to engage in SRTs.</p>
<p>Regulatory and supervisory reforms implemented since the 2008 Great Financial Crisis (GFC) make SRTs simpler and result in more scrutiny relative to credit risk transfer transactions in use before the GFC. Some jurisdictions and market participants believe there are blind spots related to disclosure and SRT financing activities.</p>
<p>The total value of protected assets in Canada, the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom, jurisdictions in which SRT markets are particularly vibrant, is estimated at about EUR 750 billion, or 1.1% of total bank assets.</p>
<p>Risks associated with SRT use, such as banks' increased dependence on&nbsp;<span>non-bank financial intermediaries (</span>NBFIs), are acknowledged and, to some extent, actively managed by market participants. However, they merit continued monitoring by supervisors as SRT markets continue to grow.</p>
<p>The report is part of the Committee's continued monitoring and investigation of the interconnections between banks and NBFIs.</p>
<hr />
<h4><em>Background:</em></h4>
<p><em>The Basel Committee is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks and provides a forum for cooperation on banking supervisory matters. Its mandate is to strengthen the regulation, supervision and practices of banks worldwide with the purpose of enhancing financial stability. The Committee reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision and seeks its endorsement for major decisions. The Committee has no formal supranational authority, and its decisions have no legal force. Rather, the Committee relies on its members' commitments to achieve its mandate. The Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision is chaired by Tiff Macklem, Governor of the Bank of Canada. The Basel Committee is chaired by Erik Thed&eacute;en, Governor of the Sveriges Riksbank.</em></p>

<title>Remarks At The Texas A&amp;M School Of Law Corporate Law Symposium, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Federal Reserve Bank Of Dallas, Feb. 17, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, David [Woodcock], for your generous introduction. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I am delighted to be here, and grateful for this opportunity to share a few reflections.</p>
<p>Let me begin by thanking our hosts at the Texas A&amp;M University School of Law for convening today&rsquo;s program. Though only in its second year, the symposium has already earned a reputation for rigor and insight. So, to address leading judges, scholars, and practitioners here, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, is a profound honor. And before I begin, let me add the customary disclaimer that the views I express here are my own as Chairman and not necessarily those of the SEC as an institution or of the other Commissioners.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Now, some of you may recall that last fall, I addressed a conference at the University of Delaware&rsquo;s Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;I spoke candidly about the declining number of public companies in our capital markets and the reforms that I believe are necessary to revitalize them. I also emphasized the important role that States play in these reforms, especially in the areas of litigation reform and shareholder proposals.&nbsp;That speech took place during a period when prominent firms were raising concerns about continuing to be domiciled in Delaware, with some moving elsewhere and encouraging others to follow suit.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Today, speaking at this symposium in Texas feels different. Indeed, Texas has begun to build something that could offer an interesting alternative to Delaware, through a framework designed to attract companies with shareholders who are eager to get back to basics, with less politicization, abusive litigation, and overall drama. That vision is rooted in a deeply American idea: that competition&mdash;among firms; among markets; and yes, among States&mdash;is the animating force behind a system that has produced more prosperity than any other in human history.</p>
<p>Of course, Delaware is no stranger to competition, for it was not always the market leader for corporate domicile. That distinction once belonged to New Jersey.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;However, in the early twentieth century, Delaware claimed that title and has held it ever since.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;But competition does not pause for tradition, nor does it defer to incumbency.&nbsp;Over time, it compels systems, and States, to adapt&mdash;or to yield. Through competition, good ideas spread, poor ones fade, and the system itself grows stronger.</p>
<p>My remarks this morning will first examine how Texas has entered that competition and what more the State might do to strengthen its position. I will then conclude with some ideas for reforming the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure regime.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>During its 2025 legislative session, Texas took several significant steps to further its appeal as a destination for corporate domestication. Among the legislative actions was Senate Bill 29 (&ldquo;SB 29&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a></p>
<p>SB 29 made several important changes to enhance protections for Texas companies&mdash;and ultimately their shareholders&mdash;against abusive lawsuits. For example, litigants will no longer be able to recover their fees from a company in actions that result solely in &ldquo;additional or amended disclosures&hellip;regardless of materiality.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;This amendment can help to deter lawsuits that are all too frequently filed&mdash;seemingly by rote&mdash;after a company releases its proxy materials for approval of a merger or an equity compensation plan. In these lawsuits, the litigants may not necessarily be seeking better proxy disclosure.&nbsp;Rather, the ulterior motive may be to seek a quick payout, knowing that companies wish to settle promptly and not delay their shareholder meeting.</p>
<p>Texas&rsquo;s consideration of the issue of attorneys&rsquo; fees in litigation signals that it recognizes their cumulative burden on capital formation. Another possible measure that many jurists and commentators have advanced is fee shifting<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&mdash;the idea that the losing party in a litigation pays the winning party&rsquo;s attorneys&rsquo; fees. Currently, companies can generally look only to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;for fee shifting in the case of frivolous federal securities law claims. However, some jurisdictions have models for fee shifting beyond their civil procedure rules. This principle, often called the English Rule, prevails in many foreign jurisdictions, not just Great Britain, and they could serve as examples for Texas to follow.</p>
<p>SB 29 also gave Texas companies more control over the venue and method of adjudicating lawsuits. For actions involving internal affairs claims, companies can now designate Texas courts as the exclusive forum for hearing those claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;They may also waive jury trials for these actions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;These changes were significant first steps in rebalancing Texas&rsquo;s process for resolving litigation.</p>
<p>However, should litigation in a court&mdash;with or without a jury&mdash;be the only method available to companies for adjudicating shareholder disputes? Another possibility is arbitration. For many years, the SEC never clearly articulated its views on whether a mandatory arbitration provision in a company&rsquo;s governing documents is inconsistent with the federal securities laws. The agency, in a very non-transparent manner, told companies on an ad hoc basis that including such a provision would mean that their IPO registration statement would not be declared effective.</p>
<p>The most recent incident appears to have been in 2012 when the Carlyle Group&mdash;which was advised by top tier law firms and had its IPO underwritten by bulge bracket banks&mdash;sought to go public with such a provision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a>&nbsp;I say &ldquo;appears to be&rdquo; because the Commission had never adopted any written principle to document this position. Instead, the SEC staff&mdash;likely at the direction of the then Chairman&mdash;advised Carlyle that its registration statement would not be declared effective as long as the mandatory arbitration provision remained. Carlyle removed the provision. To say the least, that is not the way that a United States government agency should operate.</p>
<p>However, the situation changed last September when the Commission reviewed the law as enunciated by the courts, and concluded that, based on the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decisions, mandatory arbitration provisions are not inconsistent with the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The Commission voted three-to-one to direct its staff&mdash;and clarify to the public&mdash;that this unwritten, ad hoc practice would no longer govern SEC policy.</p>
<p>The SEC has now done its part by making clear that it will not stand in the way of such provisions.&nbsp;However, before companies can adopt mandatory arbitration provisions, they must also consider the laws of their state of formation. Last summer, Delaware prohibited mandatory arbitration for federal securities law claims.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;What will Texas do?</p>
<p>Texas&rsquo;s recent amendments to its corporate laws reflect the idea that competition amongst States for domiciling corporations is a healthy function of our capital markets. They remind us that state corporate law, working in tandem with the federal securities laws, matters profoundly to our economic strength as a country, and that through those laws, we can rigorously protect shareholders without needlessly paralyzing companies. If States function as laboratories, as Justice Brandeis famously remarked,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;then the companies that operate within them often supply the ingredients for experimentation.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Let me now turn to my second topic for this morning, SEC disclosure reform. Last December, I shared my vision for returning the Commission&rsquo;s disclosure regime to its original intent of &ldquo;protect[ing] the public with the least possible interference with honest business.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;At a high level, achieving this vision of having the &ldquo;minimum effective dose of regulation&rdquo; requires the Commission to follow two ideals. First, it must root its disclosure requirements, which are contained in Regulation S-K, in the concept of financial materiality. Second, it must scale these requirements with a company&rsquo;s size and maturity.</p>
<p>Today, I will share some details on the types of reform that I have instructed the Commission staff to explore. The SEC took its first step in reforming Regulation S-K last May by soliciting public comments and hosting a roundtable on its executive compensation disclosure requirements under Item 402.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a>&nbsp;In many ways, Item 402 epitomizes the problems with the SEC&rsquo;s disclosure rules overall. The rules themselves are lengthy and complex, driven in part by piecemeal additions&nbsp;over the last two decades without a holistic review of how everything fits together. Having been chief of staff to then-Chairman Richard Breeden during the 1992 amendments to Item 402, I can say that the rule today has morphed into a Frankenstein monster beyond recognition.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the rules sometimes drive corporate behavior, rather than reflect the outcome of corporate decisions. Preparing the required disclosure consumes significant time from boards and management and can impose substantial costs through the need for specialized lawyers, accountants, and consultants. Yet, the resulting information may not benefit or protect investors because of its volume, complexity, and lack of relevance. In short, disclosure intended to inform can instead overwhelm.</p>
<p>So, it is no surprise that some of the reforms for Item 402 suggested by some commenters reflect principles that the SEC can apply throughout its rethinking of Regulation S-K. Specifically, I categorize these principles into the three buckets of rationalizing, simplifying, and modernizing the disclosure rules.</p>
<p>First is rationalizing.&nbsp;Our rules should be sensible, with materiality as their north star. Today, companies must provide detailed compensation information&mdash;through both tabular and narrative formats&mdash;for up to seven executives in a given year.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a>&nbsp;A significant number of commenters have questioned whether that scope remains justified.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;As one commenter explained, &ldquo;with the exception of the [CEO], the volume of detailed information&hellip;about the remaining [executives] is often immaterial to investors and, if anything, tends to obscure the information that they genuinely seek.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;Requiring companies to devote extensive time and resources to prepare disclosure that can do more to obscure than illuminate is not rational. I agree with commenters that we should reconsider the number of executives for whom compensation information is provided to appropriately calibrate the level of disclosure with the cost.</p>
<p>Second is simplifying.&nbsp;At the roundtable on executive compensation, one panelist described the Commission&rsquo;s pay-versus-performance (&ldquo;PvP&rdquo;) rule<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;as &ldquo;a very complex calculation&rdquo; that is difficult not only to produce but also to interpret.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of disclosure written by economists for economists,&rdquo; the panelist added.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;This sentiment should give us pause as it reflects the opposite of what an SEC disclosure requirement ideally should be&mdash;intelligible by a reasonable investor and practical for a company to comply, without the need for a cottage industry of ultra specialized consultants. Unfortunately, all of the time and money spent on PvP disclosure has scarcely resulted in clear information to investors. Another commenter noted that the rule has &ldquo;necessitate[d] further explanatory disclosure&hellip;to address any confusion&hellip;create[d] for investors.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn23">[23]</a>&nbsp;A regime that requires additional disclosure to explain the original disclosure is a signal that simplification is overdue. I agree with commenters that we should look for ways to make PvP disclosure simpler for companies to prepare and more straightforward for investors to understand.</p>
<p>Finally, modernizing.&nbsp;Few areas exemplify the need for modernization more than the treatment of executive security as a perk. When the Commission last considered this issue in 2006, it concluded that security provided at an executive&rsquo;s residence or during personal travel constituted a perk, while security provided at the office and during business travel did not.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn24">[24]</a>&nbsp;At the time, the Commission reasoned that personal security services were not &ldquo;integrally and directly related&rdquo; to job performance.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn25">[25]</a>&nbsp;But the world has changed. As one commenter noted, &ldquo;[i]n today&rsquo;s environment&hellip;comprehensive 24/7 protection is increasingly a necessity, not a luxury.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Another stated that &ldquo;[e]xecutive security is critical to the ability of many executives to perform their duties&hellip;&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn27">[27]</a>&nbsp;I agree with commenters that the Commission should modernize its perks disclosure requirements to reflect how the world and security threats have evolved over the past twenty years.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>These are just some examples of how we can sensibly reform the SEC&rsquo;s current executive compensation disclosure, which is a significant portion, but just one component, of Regulation S-K. Let me briefly address a couple of broader themes that should guide reform across the framework.</p>
<p>First is the SEC&rsquo;s attempt to indirectly regulate, or set expectations for, matters of corporate governance through &ldquo;comply or explain&rdquo; disclosure requirements. For example, if a company does not maintain a nominating or compensation committee, then it must explain why the board of directors believes that structure is appropriate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn28">[28]</a>&nbsp;If a company does not have a policy for considering director candidates recommended by shareholders, it must justify that decision.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn29">[29]</a>&nbsp;And if a company has not established a formal process for shareholders to send communications to the board, it must disclose its reasons.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn30">[30]</a>&nbsp;In theory, these are disclosure provisions. In practice, they can operate as mandates.</p>
<p>When confronted with such requirements, a company may conclude that the most prudent course is to form the committee, adopt the policy, or establish the procedure&mdash;regardless of whether it suits their particular circumstances&mdash;rather than risk appearing deficient by explanation. Absent a congressional directive,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn31">[31]</a>&nbsp;it is not the SEC&rsquo;s role to enforce evolving notions of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; governance standards through what I consider &ldquo;regulation by shaming.&rdquo; Our mandate is disclosure rooted in materiality, not governance orthodoxy enforced by embarrassment.</p>
<p>A second theme involves disclosure requirements that are impractical. For example, if a company&rsquo;s CEO departed in 2025, the company must still report his or her ownership of the company&rsquo;s stock in a proxy statement filed in 2026.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn32">[32]</a>&nbsp;Is it reasonable to require the company to track down the share ownership of its former CEO, who could have departed more than a year ago? Or consider the rules governing related-party transactions. Companies must disclose transactions between the company and an executive&rsquo;s &ldquo;immediate family members,&rdquo; a term that extends well beyond spouses and children to encompass all of one&rsquo;s in-laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn33">[33]</a>&nbsp;The rule makes no distinction based on the closeness or continuity of a relationship.&nbsp;Perhaps a more workable standard for &ldquo;immediate family members&rdquo; is whether the executive has shared a Thanksgiving meal with them in the past year.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>The final area of disclosure that I wish to address this morning is risk factors. As a Commissioner in 2005, I supported a rulemaking to extend risk factor disclosure from prospectuses to annual and quarterly reports through what became Item 1A.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn34">[34]</a>&nbsp;Based on conversations with my fellow commissioners and SEC staff at the time, we anticipated that companies would provide a concise discussion&mdash;perhaps enough to fill two or three pages&mdash;that describe &ldquo;what keeps management up at night.&rdquo; Today, however, the risk factors disclosure in a Form 10-K is on average one of the longest sections of the annual report. If PvP is disclosure written by economists for economists, then risk factors are disclosure written by lawyers for lawyers.</p>
<p>Unlike other voluminous disclosure that may result from the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook, lengthy risk factors are likely not the result of the SEC&rsquo;s rule. Item 105 of Regulation S-K expressly requires disclosure of material risks and discourages disclosure of generic ones.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn35">[35]</a>&nbsp;The Commission has previously recognized the problem with lengthy risk factors, and in 2020, amended Item 105 to require a summary if the section exceeds fifteen pages.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn36">[36]</a>&nbsp;While this rule change may have resulted in some companies reducing their risk factors disclosure to under fifteen pages, many more elected to keep their lengthy disclosures and add a summary on top of it.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn37">[37]</a>&nbsp;In fact, the overall length of many large companies&rsquo; risk factors section increased following the rule change.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn38">[38]</a></p>
<p>How can we reduce the volume of risk factors so that only material risks are presented to investors?&nbsp;The answer may depend on how we view their primary purpose. Should risk factors be disclosure written by management for investors to convey &ldquo;what keeps them up at night?&rdquo; Or are they principally a tool for establishing liability defenses, such as the &ldquo;bespeaks caution&rdquo; doctrine,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn39">[39]</a>&nbsp;or to qualify as &ldquo;meaningful cautionary statements&rdquo; under the statutory safe harbor for forward-looking statements?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn40">[40]</a>&nbsp;What is clear is that effectively reducing the volume of risk factors requires some creative ideas and out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
<p>If the primary purpose is for management to communicate to investors, then a novel idea could be to have an entity&mdash;perhaps the SEC or the company itself&mdash;maintain a set of risks, which could be published separately outside of the annual report, that broadly apply to most companies across most industries. For example, these could include impacts from U.S. legislative and regulatory developments, geopolitical issues, and natural disasters. These risks would serve as a form of &ldquo;general terms and conditions&rdquo; associated with any investment in securities. A company could refer to these risks, rather than prepare its own, and supplement them as necessary. This approach could result in a shorter risk factors section consisting of risks that are specific and material to the company.</p>
<p>However, if the primary purpose of risk factors is litigation defense, then reforms should go straight to the heart of the issue&mdash;potentially offering a safe harbor from liability. The Commission could adopt a rule stating that failure to disclose impacts from publicized events that are reasonably likely to affect most companies will not constitute material omissions for purposes of some or all of the federal securities laws&rsquo; anti-fraud rules. Such a safe harbor could incentivize companies to include fewer generic risk factors by shielding them from liability for events related to those generic risks. After all, if companies are not compelled to catalogue nearly every conceivable contingency to guard against hindsight litigation, then they can focus on risks that are more distinctive to their business.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>I offer these ideas in the spirit of starting a conversation about the primary purpose of risk factors and rule-based corporate disclosure generally. How can we right-size their length and complexity without diminishing their value?&nbsp;Most importantly, I am eager to hear your ideas&mdash;and encourage you to be bold and creative. Beyond risk factors, I also welcome your views and feedback on the broader principles, themes, and ideas that I have shared today regarding executive compensation disclosure and the other parts of Regulation S-K. The SEC is currently accepting written comments on these topics, and I hope that you will submit yours as soon as possible.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn41">[41]</a></p>
<p>For those of you more focused on Texas corporate law, this state has begun to build something that could have lasting ramifications. I am excited to see what happens over the next few years, including any further changes to the corporate law during next year&rsquo;s legislative session. As baseball&rsquo;s spring training begins, I am reminded that &ldquo;if [Texas] build[s] it, [the companies] will come.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-02-17-2026-remarks-texas-am-school-law-corporate-law-symposium?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn42">[42]</a></p>
<p>It has been my pleasure speaking with you this morning. You have been a patient and indulgent audience. And you have my best wishes for a wonderful remainder of this conference. Thank you.</p>

<title>Millions In Unhedged FX Losses To Drive Return To Protection In 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>A new report from&nbsp;advanced FX and cash management solutions provider, MillTech, has revealed that UK corporates lost an average of &pound;6.71m in 2025 due to unhedged FX exposure, while US firms lost $9.85m, driving a renewed focus on currency protection in 2026.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://milltech.com/resources/currency-insight-and-education/the-corporate-hedging-monitor-q4-2025" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://milltech.com/resources/currency-insight-and-education/the-corporate-hedging-monitor-q4-2025">MillTech&rsquo;s Q4 2025 Corporate Hedging Monitor</a></span>&nbsp;includes findings from a survey of 250 senior finance decision-makers at UK and US corporates and reveals that four in five firms (80%) reported losses from unhedged risk in 2025, with nearly a fifth (19%) describing these as significant.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop, corporate hedging activity rebounded from Q3 lows, signalling a renewed focus on risk reduction. The average hedge ratio rose from 46% to 49%, although it remains below levels seen before Q3 2025.</p>
<p>Hedge tenors also lengthened, increasing from an average of 5.8 to 6.3 months, in line with levels recorded in the first half of 2025. In the UK, average hedge lengths marginally exceeded those of Q4 2024, highlighting a renewed willingness among corporates to lock in protection for longer and improve cash flow certainty.</p>
<p>Central bank policy and inflation rates emerged as the most influential external factors shaping FX hedging decisions, each cited by 17% of corporates. Notably, this was the first time inflation rates ranked joint top, while central bank policy has consistently led the list since Q2 2025.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, tariff-driven market uncertainty is prompting a more defensive outlook. Nearly two-thirds of corporates plan to increase hedge ratios (64%) and extend hedge tenors (59%), with UK firms more inclined to do so than their US counterparts. Only a small minority expect to reduce coverage, with 10% planning to lower hedge ratios and 9% hedge lengths.</p>
<p><b>Eric Huttman, CEO of MillTech, commented:&nbsp;</b>&ldquo;Q4 2025 marked a clear shift back towards defensive FX management. While hedge ratios and tenors increased, they have not yet returned to early-2025 levels, suggesting firms continue to balance protection against cost and flexibility. However, with most corporates experiencing losses from unhedged exposure, 2026 is likely to see further increases in coverage as tariff and policy-driven uncertainty persists and major currencies recorded their largest swings in nearly a year.&rdquo;</p>

(Quantoz) the Netherlands headquartered payments technology company, is pleased to announce that it has entered into a partnership with Visa to become a direct Visa principal member. The agreement enables Quantoz to facilitate the issue of virtual Visa debit cards and act as a BIN-sponsor for third-party fintechs and platforms, allowing their customers to spend e-money/ stablecoins wherever Visa is accepted.</span></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Through the partnership, Quantoz will support the issuance of virtual Visa cards that can be used wherever Visa is accepted - online, in-store, and via mobile wallets such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. A customer&rsquo;s account balance held with Quantoz will represent the spendable balance on the card, enabling fintechs and platforms to extend the utility of regulated digital money into familiar, everyday payment experiences. The solution is designed as part of Quantoz&rsquo;s broader embedded payments offering, with technical integration currently underway.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Arnoud Star Busmann, CEO of Quantoz Payments, commented:</span></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><i>&ldquo;Becoming a Visa principal member is a major milestone for Quantoz. It allows us to make regulated digital money truly usable in day-to-day payments, while removing the complexity for fintechs and platforms. By handling the regulatory, operational and technical heavy lifting, we enable our partners to launch branded card products that connect compliant digital money with one of the world&rsquo;s most widely accepted payment networks.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">Jos van de Kerkhof, Visa Country Manager for the Netherlands, said:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><i>&ldquo;Visa is focused on enabling innovation across the payments ecosystem and supporting new ways for digital value to be used within trusted payment experiences. Partnerships like this help fintechs and platforms explore how regulated digital money can integrate with established card infrastructure, while maintaining strong standards for security and compliance.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p class="gmail-MsoNoSpacing"><span face="arial, sans-serif" style="font-family: arial, sans-serif;">The partnership is focused on the European market and will allow fintech and platform partners to embed virtual Visa card issuance directly into their products, with flexibility around branding, pricing models and card controls. As integration progresses, Quantoz plans to work closely with partners to support new consumer and business payment use cases built on regulated digital money.</span></p>

The investor participant with the highest return generated on the ADX each month will be awarded 1 million Etihad Guest Miles &ndash; enough for several first-class flights to New York and London. Additionally, the 2nd to 10th top performers will receive prizes ranging from 100,000 to 500,000 miles every month.</p>
<p>The competition underscores the strong performance of ADX-listed companies, which continue to deliver substantial dividends and a solid performance, underpinned by Abu Dhabi and the UAE&rsquo;s resilient economic fundamentals. In 2025, ADX-listed companies distributed 74 billion dirhams in cash dividends, marking a 9.4% increase year on year.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How to Win 1 Million Guest Miles</h4>
<p>For an open, level playing field, the competition will determine winners based on their timeweighted return (TWR) percentage, which measures trading skill rather than portfolio size. The competition will be held once a month for three months. It is open to all investors with an active Al Ramz trading account, with no minimum investment required. Participants can anonymously track their performance on a dedicated web portal.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Empowering a Stronger and More Skilled Financial Community</h4>
<p>The Al Ramz&ndash;ADX collaboration is part of both partners&rsquo; commitment to the UAE&rsquo;s ambition of building up a financially knowledgeable community to enable a thriving and sustainable economy. This fun engagement is an extension of Al Ramz and ADX&rsquo;s efforts to support the UAE&rsquo;s Year of Family 2026 objectives to (i) boost financial and investment knowledge, (ii) encourage long-term financial capability, and (iii) create a stronger community of informed investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>May the best trader win!&nbsp;</p>

<p>HM Treasury is progressing work to apply the UK&rsquo;s established model of regulation for financial services, known as the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act 2000">FSMA</abbr>&nbsp;model, to the law the UK inherited from the EU (known as assimilated law) on the capital framework for banks, building societies and investment firms.&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act 2000">FSMA</abbr>&nbsp;refers to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.</p>
<p>This policy update confirms the legislative approach for implementing the final post-crisis reforms to banks&rsquo; capital requirements, known as Basel 3.1. It explains how HM Treasury will revoke certain parts of the Capital Requirements Regulation (&ldquo;the&nbsp;<abbr title="Capital Requirements Regulation">CRR</abbr>&rdquo;, which is the central piece of assimilated law on bank capital requirements), which the Prudential Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>) will then replace with rules implementing the new Basel standards.</p>
<p>The update also outlines the proposed legislative approach for revoking the remainder of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Capital Requirements Regulation">CRR</abbr>&nbsp;and for revoking and restating with modifications the Capital Buffers Regulation. Completing the application of the&nbsp;<abbr title="Financial Services and Markets Act 2000">FSMA</abbr>&nbsp;model to this area of assimilated law will pave the way for a number of further reforms to the prudential regime proposed by the&nbsp;<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>, including a proportionate prudential regime for smaller banks and building societies.</p>
<p>HM Treasury has published three pieces of draft legislation alongside the policy update and would welcome technical comments on the proposed legislative approach within the next 6 weeks. The&nbsp;<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>&nbsp;has also published a number of corresponding policy documents that set out the final Basel 3.1 package and further reforms the&nbsp;<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>&nbsp;proposes to make to the prudential regime.</p>
<div class="call-to-action">
<p><strong>Update as of 17 January 2025:</strong>&nbsp;The Prudential Regulation Authority (<abbr title="Prudential Regulation Authority">PRA</abbr>), in consultation with HM Treasury, has decided to delay the implementation of Basel 3.1 in the UK by one year until 1 January 2027.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>January 2026 opened with continued global market volatility, driven by lingering geopolitical tensions and the threat of trade tariffs. Despite the tumultuous start, the FTSE Mondo Visione Index climbed 3.2%, closing the month at 96,985.19 points, up from December's 93,979.05 points.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Top 5 Exchanges by Market Capitalisation (USD bn)</p>
<ol>
<li>CME Group &ndash; 104.16&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Intercontinental Exchange &ndash; 99.84&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing &ndash; 70.16&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>London Stock Exchange Group &ndash; 57.67&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Nasdaq &ndash; 55.63&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange emerged as January's top performer, delivering a remarkable 30.1% capital return in U.S. dollars. Brazil's B3 followed with a 21.7% rise, while ASX rounded out the top three at 17%. On the other hand, the Bulgarian Stock Exchange declined 23.6%, ranking as the worst performer, followed by Croatia's Zagrebacka Burza (-20.6%) and Boursa Kuwait Securities (-14.7%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Herbie Skeete, Managing Director of Mondo Visione, commented, "CME Group continues to dominate, driven by strong futures and options trading. With heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, we anticipate sustained trading activity, particularly in interest rate, energy, and metals contracts, which should further support CME's transaction-based revenues."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="pr-story--text pr-text-font">Transaction Network Services (TNS) today announced an upgrade to its TNS&nbsp;<a href="https://tnsi.com/solutions/financial/market-data/">Data Usage Optimizer</a>&nbsp;(DUO) with the launch of an interactive customer portal. Building on&nbsp;<a href="https://tnsi.com/resource/fin/tns-launches-market-data-monitoring-solution-press-release/">the launch of DUO</a>&nbsp;in late 2024, this new interface offers buy-side and sell-side firms direct, on-demand access to the DUO portal to analyze market data subscriptions, identify unused services, and eliminate unnecessary spend.<br /><br />Market data is one of the largest operational expenses for financial firms, yet costs can be notoriously difficult to manage. The new DUO portal turns complex, raw data files from vendor entitlement systems into an actionable dashboard, allowing firms to quickly pinpoint and eradicate non-essential costs. TNS has used DUO with global banks and financial firms and in the case of one bank, TNS identified monthly&nbsp;<a href="https://tnsi.com/resource/com/how-tns-helped-a-leading-global-bank-achieve-significant-market-data-cost-reduction-use-case/">savings of $60,000</a>&nbsp;by highlighting unused data feeds.&nbsp;<br /><br />"Last year we introduced DUO to solve a critical industry problem. Today, we're putting the power to control market data costs directly into our customers' hands," said Tom Lazenga, General Manager, TNS Financial Markets. "The DUO portal empowers data managers and desk heads to instantly identify and act on potential savings."<br /><br />The DUO portal is the second release of the software and provides a centralized, global view of data expenses.

<p class="p--heading-1">As Credit Index Futures continue to reshape the landscape of credit derivatives trading, Eurex is proud to spotlight the voices of our most influential partners. In this exclusive series, we sit down with leading market participants from firms that have played a pivotal role in the development, adoption, and evolution of Credit Index Futures at Eurex.</p>

<p>From early product design to global market expansion, these conversations offer unique insights into how Credit Index Futures are being used across trading desks, what differentiates them from other instruments, and where the market is headed next.</p>
<p><strong>Jasper Jansen</strong>&nbsp;is the head of Fixed Income Trading at Flow Traders Europe and one of the earliest and biggest supporters of Eurex Credit Index Futures. He has been instrumental in establishing the product by providing pricing off- and on-screen since day one and has been most outspoken in his belief in Credit Index Futures. Following the launch of the Credit Derivatives Partnership Program, he sat down with us to discuss his and the firm&rsquo;s involvement in Credit Index Futures and where he sees the market developing.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Eurex: Jasper, you have been a staunch supporter of Credit Index Futures at Eurex from the start, establishing a market in these by providing executable prices in the orderbook and off-book markets. Please explain to us what excited you about the product and how your vision was able to come to fruition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="dbx-picture image float--left">
<img class="dbx-picture__img" src="https://www.eurex.com/resource/blob/4953120/dada4b9c8d064ada32f28a3a0006c01a/data/20260213_partner_perspectives_Flow_Traders%E2%80%99_Jasper_Jansen_picture.jpg" /><figcaption class="dbx-picture__caption">Jasper Jansen</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jasper Jansen:</strong>&nbsp;What immediately excited me about Credit Index Futures was the opportunity to bring an alternative to CDS and TRS instruments in credit markets. Credit is a core asset class, yet access to standardized, centrally cleared tools was relatively limited compared to rates or equities.</p>
<p>From the outset, our vision was that Credit Index Futures could become a true benchmark instrument for trading and hedging credit risk, provided there was consistent liquidity, tight pricing, and confidence in execution. At Flow Traders, we believed that if we committed to providing executable prices both on-screen and off-book from day one, we could help accelerate that adoption cycle.</p>
<p>Over time, that vision has come to fruition through close collaboration with Eurex and other market participants. By actively contributing to price formation and market depth, we helped demonstrate that these products can trade efficiently across market conditions, which in turn encouraged broader participation from our counterparties and other liquidity providers.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Eurex: We were excited by your and Flow Traders enthusiastic support during the critical initial days of launching the product. Could you please share some considerations and feedback that your counterparties had in the early days and how has that changed over time?</p>
<p><strong>Jasper Jansen:</strong>&nbsp;In the early days, the feedback from market participants was understandably focused on liquidity, consistency, and transaction costs. Many of our counterparties are familiar with credit exposure through cash products such as ETFs and bonds and wanted to understand how Credit Index Futures would behave in terms of tracking, roll mechanics, and execution during periods of volatility.</p>
<p>Over time, as liquidity improved and pricing became more reliable, the conversation shifted. Today, our counterparties are increasingly focused on scalability, execution efficiency, and portfolio applications. We see growing confidence in using Credit Index Futures not only for hedging but also for tactical positioning and relative-value strategies.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Eurex: Credit futures markets are embedded in an ecosystem of other derivatives and cash products such as ETFs, Corporate Bonds, Credit-Default-Swaps and Total Return Swaps. How do you find your counterparties using the products and what are the biggest differentiators that you find for credit index futures compared to the other alternatives?</p>
<p><strong>Jasper Jansen:</strong>&nbsp;Our counterparties use Credit Index Futures in a variety of ways, from macro hedging and beta exposure to more granular relative-value and arbitrage strategies against ETFs, CDS indices, and cash bonds. What stands out is how naturally the product integrates into a broader multi-asset derivatives framework. The key differentiators are standardization, transparency, and capital efficiency.</p>
<p>For many of our counterparties, Credit Index Futures serve as a bridging instrument, linking cash credit markets with derivatives in a way that is operationally efficient and easy to scale. That makes them particularly attractive in fast-moving markets where execution certainty matters.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Eurex: Having witnessed this success story in Europe firsthand, how do you think the market will develop globally?</p>
<p><strong>Jasper Jansen:</strong>&nbsp;Europe has shown that with the right market structure, committed liquidity provision, and strong exchange support, Credit Index Futures can gain meaningful traction. I believe this success provides a clear blueprint for global expansion.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, I expect increased adoption across regions as market participants continue to prioritize capital efficiency, transparency, and electronic execution. Regulatory developments and balance sheet considerations will further support the shift toward listed, cleared products.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Credit Index Futures have the potential to become a core global risk-transfer instrument in credit markets, much like rate futures are today. As liquidity deepens and use cases expand, we expect them to play an increasingly central role in how credit risk is traded and managed worldwide.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Summary Of AI roundtables - February 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Bank of England held roundtable meetings with representatives from regulated firms on the responsible adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI and ML), to better understand the constraints that firms may be facing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="page-section">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>As per the Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2025/the-boes-approach-to-innovation-in-ai-dlt-quantum-computing">approach to innovation in AI, DLT and quantum computing</a>, we seek to engage with innovators and industry practitioners in various ways to better understand the latest technological developments and their implications for the financial sector. This includes via&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/report/2024/artificial-intelligence-in-uk-financial-services-2024">biennial AI surveys of the UK financial sector</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/fintech/artificial-intelligence-consortium">the AI Consortium</a>&nbsp;(a successor to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/research/fintech/ai-public-private-forum">AI Public-Private Forum</a>), the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group AI Taskforce, and the Bank&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-intelligence">Market Intelligence function</a>.</p>
<p>To complement these initiatives, and in line with the Bank&rsquo;s secondary growth objective, in late 2025, the Bank of England hosted three roundtables with participants from regulated firms to better understand the constraints firms may be facing in adopting AI, and how the Bank and PRA can support responsible AI adoption. Each roundtable was held with representatives from a different PRA-regulated sector: (1) challenger banks and UK-focussed larger banks; (2) global systemically important banks; and (3) insurers. Observers from the FCA and HMT were also present.</p>
<p>Below is a summary of the key points arising from the roundtable discussions, which were held under the Chatham House Rule.</p>
</section><section class="page-section">
<h2>Summary of key points</h2>
<p><span>Across all three roundtables, participants from regulated firms expressed support for the PRA&rsquo;s regulatory framework as it related to AI.</span>&nbsp;Participants noted that the PRA&rsquo;s principles-based, outcomes-based policy and supervisory statements gave firms sufficient space to innovate within clear regulatory guardrails. Supervisory Statement 1/23 on Model Risk Management in particular was noted by several participants as pragmatic in enabling responsible AI adoption. Most participants did not see the need yet for detailed AI-specific regulatory guidance or rules, and most couldn&rsquo;t see a case for a Bank or PRA AI sandbox at this time; the FCA&rsquo;s Supercharged Sandbox and AI Live Testing initiatives were seen as providing sufficient offerings for testing purposes.</p>
<p><span>Second-line risk functions continue to approach the use of AI with caution, which may delay AI deployment pipelines</span>. There were mixed views on whether this was an optimal or inevitable level of caution. Drivers could include both (a) bottlenecks in AI skills and expertise, given the dynamic and highly complex nature of the technology, and the range of uses to which it was being put; and (b) a desire to ensure compliance with supervisory expectations could be comprehensively demonstrated. As an example, several participants noted that firms&rsquo;<span>&nbsp;</span>traditional model risk management approach to validation wouldn&rsquo;t be sustainable in its current form as generative AI and agentic systems proliferated. The traditional emphasis on understanding the inner workings of a model &ndash; i.e. how inputs mapped to outputs &ndash;wasn&rsquo;t tenable or fully effective for increasingly complex AI models. The concept of having a &lsquo;human-in-the-loop&rsquo; was also challenged by the rise of agentic AI. Several participants suggested that risk management needed to evolve to put greater emphasis on testing, monitoring and setting guardrails around the outcomes of broader AI systems. Some participants suggested there would be value in sharing supervisory observations on good and bad practice, or convening industry experts to define, agree and share best practice.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2026/february/summary-of-ai-roundtables-feb-2026#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup></p>
<p><span>Firms operating in multiple jurisdictions need to navigate different regulatory approaches to AI.&nbsp;</span>Participants noted key differences between the UK&rsquo;s regulatory approach, the US&rsquo;s approach (e.g. Supervisory Letter SR11-7 on Guidance on Model Risk Management) and the EU AI Act. Fragmentation increases compliance costs, slowed AI adoption, and prevented firms from scaling AI use cases across borders. Several participants therefore encouraged the Bank to use its membership of various international fora to encourage global coordination and convergence.</p>
<p><span>Procurement and contract negotiations with third-party AI providers were slowed by inconsistent familiarity with regulated firms&rsquo; compliance requirements.</span>&nbsp;Some participants thought the market would eventually solve that problem i.e. minimum standards would emerge over time, but that there was an opportunity cost in the meantime. Several participants therefore<span>&nbsp;</span>noted that the Bank could explore convening financial and technology firms to agree minimum standards for third party AI providers to the regulated financial sector. Some participants noted that as AI models become embedded in agentic systems throughout their firm&rsquo;s core business processes, substituting between AI providers may become more challenging.</p>
<p><span>Data protection laws &ndash; along with emerging data sovereignty regimes in other jurisdictions &ndash; were a challenge to deploying and scaling AI use cases.&nbsp;</span>Several participants noted that the legal requirement to complete Data Protection Impact Assessments in certain situations slowed their AI deployment pipeline.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2026/february/summary-of-ai-roundtables-feb-2026#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;Participants noted that new data location requirements could prevent scaling AI solutions across borders.</p>
<p><span>Data quality can also be a barrier to the use of AI, particularly in some areas of insurance.&nbsp;</span>Some insurers have relatively little data on their individual customers, owing to the infrequency of customer engagement (e.g. annual policy renewal, when a claim is submitted), in contrast to banks&rsquo; visibility of their customers&rsquo; transactions. Therefore prospects of e.g. hyperpersonalised insurance products using AI were limited in some areas in the near term.</p>

<title>Eurex - Buffer ETFs In Europe</title>

<div>
<p class="p--heading-1">Ahead of the Eurex Derivatives Forum Frankfurt on February 25-26, we sat down with Sushil Krishan, Managing Director at Goldman Sachs on recent growth in Buffer ETFs, the effect this rise might have on derivatives markets and its prospects in Europe.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="dbx-container dbx-richtext">
<div class="dbx-row">
<div class="dbx-col-sm-12 dbx-col-md-12 dbx-col-xl-10">
<div>
<p><strong>What is the current state of the Buffer ETF market in Europe?</strong></p>
<p>Over the last three years, the asset growth in Buffer ETFs has been almost exponential, moving from virtually zero to way above $100 billion<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;in the US and in Europe.</p>
<p>Initially there were all sorts of doubts as to whether these products would take off in Europe. People argued that the market was too small and couldn&rsquo;t grow in the same way the US market did. It was very much a let's wait and see attitude.</p>
<p>Now, within less than a year, the European market has already grown to more than $5 billion. The demand is clearly there, and the products are perceived advantageous to investors.</p>
<p>These are not very new products - back in 2008/9, ETFs that essentially ran collar strategies were already being launched by some issuers, but they never grew above $20 million AuM. They were too far ahead of the curve as a product.</p>
<p>Now, the dynamics have shifted quite fundamentally, and investors are looking at these products quite extensively as a tool for their overall portfolio construction. In addition, as the ETF space has grown, with more retail investors taking a passive approach, more products are moving in that direction.</p>
<p>These products can be seen as an extension to the QIS offering which recorded tremendous growth in the past years. Banks have been very active in that market through OTC channels. Traditionally, their clients were actively managed or hedge funds, and it was not a very accessible space for retail investors. Now however, this market is starting to convert into passive investing models.</p>
<p><strong>What effect will these trends have on derivatives markets?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, there will a much greater concentration in volume as the number of assets in Buffer ETFs keeps growing into the billions.</p>
<p>The typical structure of these funds is selling a call and buying a put with some sort of variety in strikes and maturities. The call selling generates a premium for the ETF to buy a put again. It can be structured in different ways, by distributing trading over time, or using different maturities and strikes. It gives the investors some protection on the downside and captures some of the upside. It makes the product less volatile, which is the perfect match for a more conservative and income-oriented type of investing.</p>
<p>What we are already observing in the US is that call selling can become so concentrated and account for such a large portion of activity that it starts influencing the market itself. In the past, call selling strategies have started to cap the market itself as more money flows into the strategy. As long as the underlying asset is increasing towards the call strike the dealer community becomes more long gamma, which caps the market with growing volumes.</p>
<p>On the flip side of the trade, the put buying makes the dealer community that facilitates this downside protection short gamma. This dynamic reduces volatility on the upside but increases volatility on the downside. It is already observable in the US and given that volumes are increasing in Europe we should start to see this emerging in Europe, which is a much less liquid market. It is going to be very interesting to see how these dynamics unfold in the coming years and the effect they have on the derivatives ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>What are the main challenges to growing the European market?</strong></p>
<p>There is always a big difference between any European market and its US equivalent. Europe is much more fragmented than the US, which is a very concentrated market for trading. There are also traditional differences in retail investing. The US is a much more independent and equity focused investment culture, while in Europe you need institutional interest to gain significant asset growth.</p>
<p>For ETFs more specifically, there is also a significant difference in how these vehicles are constructed. In Europe, to be an ETF, issuers have to use the UCITS framework, which limits what a fund can do to a very high degree.</p>
<p>In the US, we are seeing Buffer ETFs of high volatility and performing single stocks like Nvidia. It is very hard to do something like that in Europe, if not impossible, due to the diversification rules in the UCITS framework. Those restrictions don&rsquo;t exist in the US.</p>
<p>So, the spectrum of these products in Europe is set to center much more around overlay strategies on a diversified basket.</p>
<p>The question remains though: will insurance companies, pension funds and corporate clients start to buy these ETFs where the overlay strategy is incorporated, instead of buying the assets and running an overlay strategy themselves?</p>
<p>That brings us back to the different investor bases in Europe and the US, because in the end that is where the volume will be generated. I believe that in around a year this will start to accelerate. One and a half years ago, total assets in Buffer ETFs were less than a billion across all the funds in Europe. That has since grown by about 5-10 times<a href="https://marquee.gs.com/content/research/en/reports/2026/02/05/a98eb842-827e-4195-9491-4586cd1d37fc.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;within a very short period and is clearly being driven by institutional adoption. The question then is what happens to the other overlay strategies? Will we see a reduction in the ones run bilaterally for institutional clients with the banks, as that activity transfers to ETFs?</p>
<p>[1]&nbsp;<a href="https://marquee.gs.com/content/research/en/reports/2026/02/05/a98eb842-827e-4195-9491-4586cd1d37fc.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source: GS GIR as of Feb2026&nbsp;</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span><span><span><span>In a new milestone underscoring the rapid development of Qatar&rsquo;s debt capital market and QNB Group&rsquo;s continued leadership in local currency funding, Qatar Stock Exchange (QSE) today announced the successful listing of QNB Group&rsquo;s bonds, representing the largest Qatari riyal&ndash;denominated bond issuance in the history of the local market.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The bonds were offered exclusively to international investors and were fully subscribed by a diversified investor base, reflecting strong confidence in QNB Group&rsquo;s financial strength, credit profile, and regional leadership, as well as &nbsp;in the resilience and stability of Qatar&rsquo;s financial system. The issuance totals QAR 1 billion, with a one-year tenor and an annual coupon rate of 4%.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The transaction forms part of QNB Group&rsquo;s broader funding diversification strategy, reinforcing its prudent liquidity management and ability to access international capital in local currency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>This listing marks a significant milestone in the ongoing development of QSE&rsquo;s debt instruments market, demonstrating the local market&rsquo;s capacity to accommodate large-scale issuances in local currency within a robust regulatory framework and advanced trading, clearing, and settlement infrastructure, thereby enhancing market efficiency and transparency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Commenting on the occasion, Mr. Abdulla Mohammed Al-Ansari, Chief Executive Officer of Qatar Stock Exchange, said: &ldquo;The listing of the largest Qatari riyal&ndash;denominated bond issuance in market history represents a key milestone in the development of Qatar&rsquo;s capital market. It underscores QSE&rsquo;s pivotal role in deepening the debt market and expanding the range of investment products available to investors. This achievement also reflects growing confidence in the local market and its ability to attract international investment into instruments denominated in the national currency, enhancing market liquidity and supporting the diversification of funding sources.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>He added that the listing reflects the high level of coordination and integration across Qatar&rsquo;s national financial ecosystem, including Qatar Stock Exchange, Qatar Central Bank, the Qatar Financial Markets Authority, and EDAA (Qatar Central Securities Depository), in alignment with the objectives of the Third Financial Sector Strategy and Qatar National Vision 2030.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>QNB Group Chief Executive Officer, Abdulla Mubarak Al-Khalifa, added: &ldquo;This landmark issuance reflects QNB Group&rsquo;s disciplined funding strategy and our continued commitment to deepening Qatar&rsquo;s capital markets. The strong demand from international investors underscores confidence in QNB&rsquo;s credit fundamentals and in Qatar&rsquo;s economic outlook. We remain focused on maintaining a well-diversified funding base that supports sustainable growth while contributing to the development of the local currency debt market.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>The listing of QNB&rsquo;s bonds follows a series of notable developments in QSE&rsquo;s debt market in recent years, including the listing of the first corporate bonds, the first Islamic sukuk, the first sustainable bonds, and the first green sukuk, culminating in the listing of the largest Qatari riyal&ndash;denominated bond issuance in the market&rsquo;s history.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The listing represents a qualitative addition to Qatar&rsquo;s capital market, contributing to the deepening of the domestic debt market and enhancing liquidity in local currency instruments. It also supports the development of a benchmark yield curve, improving pricing efficiency for future issuances. For investors, the listing offers a short-term investment instrument with clear returns within a regulated and transparent framework, supporting portfolio diversification and efficient liquidity management. At the broader ecosystem level, the transaction demonstrates the market&rsquo;s ability to accommodate large-scale issuances and attract a diversified base of international investors, reinforcing QSE&rsquo;s role as an integrated platform for capital formation in line with Qatar National Vision 2030 and the objectives of financial sector development.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>At the financial ecosystem level, the listing enables issuers to access a sophisticated domestic market capable of attracting international capital into local currency instruments, enhancing funding flexibility and long-term sustainability.

<title>Revitalizing Bank Mortgage Lending, One Step With Basel, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At The American Bankers Association 2026 Conference For Community Bankers, Orlando, Florida</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a pleasure to join you again this year for the American Bankers Association Community Bankers Conference. As a former community banker, I always enjoy taking time to learn from your experience to inform my work at the Federal Reserve.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Today, I would like to discuss a concerning trend in our financial system that has significant implications for the banking industry, the stability of the mortgage market, and consumers. Whether due to a conscious decision in response to the regulatory environment or other factors, we have seen a significant migration of mortgage origination and servicing out of the banking sector. The data tells a clear story. In 2008, banks originated around 60 percent of mortgages and held the servicing rights on about 95 percent of mortgage balances. Since that time, the contraction has been extraordinary. As of 2023, banks originated only 35 percent of mortgages and serviced about 45 percent of mortgage balances.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Taking a step back to understand the magnitude of this change, as regulators, we have a responsibility to determine whether prudential regulations have driven this shift. We should also consider whether the regulations are appropriately calibrated to the risk that mortgage origination and servicing pose to the banking system. This out-migration of origination and servicing has been costly for banks, consumers, and the overall mortgage system. In part, this results from over calibration of the capital treatment for these activities, resulting in requirements that are both disproportionate to risk and that make mortgage activities too costly for banks to engage. I see a path forward that incorporates both renewed bank participation in the mortgage market and a safe and sound banking system.</p>
<p><span>Why This Migration Matters</span><br />For Banks: Mortgages are an important component of the business model. This is not only from a revenue perspective, but because banking is fundamentally a relationship business. The purchase of a home is a major life milestone, and banks should be able to offer this service to their customers. In addition, most banks prefer to retain mortgage servicing in-house to ensure positive customer experiences. We know that servicing creates customer loyalty when done well but can create significant frustration when done poorly.</p>
<p>The relationship benefits that the mortgage business offers are substantial. Customers with strong bank connections naturally turn to that bank for other financial needs, from checking accounts to investment services. This can create a virtuous circle&mdash;good customer service in the mortgage business can lead to a stronger relationship with customers and result in improved bank financial resiliency. Mortgage servicing also offers distinct financial benefits. The fee income from mortgage servicing diversifies a bank's revenue stream from an over-reliance on lending income, providing more stable income independent of the interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Banks also have structural advantages in servicing. The customer relationships built through mortgage lending may be more valuable for banks than nonbanks because they can cross-sell more products and services than nonbanks. Escrow balances must be held in insured accounts, providing banks with funds to support lending activities as they would those in any other deposit account. Many servicing contracts require the servicer to advance principal, interest, and other payments on behalf of delinquent borrowers. Banks can more easily comply with these requirements than nonbanks because banks have access to stable, low-cost sources of funding.</p>
<p>For Consumers: Turning next to consumers, fewer banks engaged in mortgage origination and servicing has reduced the consumer choice and competition that drives down costs. In addition, borrowers that experience financial distress seem to fare worse during financial downturns with nonbank servicers. During COVID-19, borrowers with bank servicers were more likely to receive forbearance on their mortgage payments than those with nonbank servicers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>For Financial Stability: Nonbank servicers face other vulnerabilities, as described in a recent report issued by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;Perhaps the greatest risk they present is that the regulatory and resolution frameworks for these mortgage companies have not kept pace with their growth. When a large bank servicer fails, regulators have tools to ensure core servicing functions continue&mdash;requiring that borrower mortgage payments are credited correctly and that borrowers in financial distress receive appropriate modifications. Nonbank servicers are subject to far fewer safeguards.</p>
<p><span>The Capital Treatment Challenge</span><br />We can clearly see from academic research and industry feedback that the 2013 change in capital treatment of mortgage servicing rights was a factor in the withdrawal of banks from the mortgage market.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;When a financial institution securitizes a mortgage by selling it to a securitization trust, the institution receives a "mortgage servicing right," or MSR, as a byproduct of the sale. That MSR represents the expected present value of the net servicing income that the institution will receive over the life of the mortgage&mdash;including the anticipated servicing fees minus the expenses.</p>
<p>These changes to the MSR capital treatment were two-fold. First, most banks experienced modest to moderate increases in their risk weights for MSRs, depending on how the banks accounted for the MSRs on their balance sheets.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Second, banks holding significant amounts of MSRs faced an even more stringent capital treatment, in that any MSRs exceeding a certain percentage of capital (called the "deduction threshold") received disproportionately high risk weights.</p>
<p><span>Reconsidering the Balance</span><br />At the time, regulators tightened MSR capital treatment for sound reasons. MSR valuations can be challenging to calculate because they are not based on transaction prices in liquid markets. Instead, they are derived from models that depend on subjective assumptions about mortgage prepayment and the likelihood of default. This makes the valuations volatile, especially during interest rate swings, and we have observed that during periods of high defaults, some MSR markets can experience stress or seize up.</p>
<p>These are legitimate concerns, and I want to be clear that holding MSRs is not the right choice for every bank. Successfully managing the volatility in MSR valuations as interest rates change requires sophisticated hedging capabilities or an effective borrower retention strategy during refinancing waves. Servicing can also carry substantial operational risk and compliance responsibility. Banks that engage in mortgage servicing must have sufficient expertise and resources to manage these risks and the associated responsibilities in a safe and sound manner.</p>
<p>That said, regulators are much more familiar with MSRs since the 2013 regulations were put in place, and we have also learned a great deal about how the capital treatment of MSRs has affected bank decisions about mortgage origination and servicing. Turning first to origination, when banks decide whether to originate and how to price mortgages, they consider the value of the MSR that they receive after the securitization sale. The capital treatment makes that MSR less valuable. Since banks securitize roughly 75 percent of their mortgage originations to low- to-moderate income, or LMI, borrowers, the capital treatment may particularly affect mortgage availability and affordability for these borrowers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20260216a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Turning next to servicing, we have learned that the deduction threshold may impede a bank's ability to build a profitable servicing business. This effect may be more consequential for smaller banks. Mortgage servicing requires substantial fixed investments in personnel and technology, making it more cost-effective at larger volumes. However, smaller banks may not be able to build a servicing portfolio of that size without creating an MSR in excess of the deduction threshold.</p>
<p>Risk weights for mortgages held in bank portfolios also affect bank decisions about mortgage market engagement and pricing. Are these risk weights calibrated appropriately to the underlying risk? Consider a mortgage's loan-to-value ratio, or LTV. Capital rules impose the same risk weight regardless of LTV, but default probability and the severity of losses vary substantially with LTV. Low-LTV mortgages carry low expected losses&mdash;borrowers have strong incentives to protect their equity, and collateral values well exceed the bank's credit exposure. Further, the risk of a mortgage default decreases over time as the principal is paid down and the mortgage migrates to lower LTV buckets.</p>
<p>This misalignment between capital requirements and actual risk has important consequences. Banks hold substantial numbers of mortgages with low loan-to-value ratios. By requiring disproportionately high capital, we reduce a bank's ability to deploy capital to support the needs of their community. In light of these considerations, I am open to revisiting whether the capital treatment of MSRs and mortgages is appropriately calibrated and is commensurate with the risks.</p>
<p><span>Proposed Path Forward</span><br />While there are many rules that govern bank mortgage origination and servicing, my discussion today focuses on the bank regulatory capital treatment, which represents only a small part of the broader mortgage problem. Comprehensively addressing mortgage market challenges would also require revisiting Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules and legislative requirements. Let me highlight a few areas within the Basel framework that could effectively address some challenges and that we are considering for potential modification.</p>
<p>Two regulatory proposals will soon be introduced that, among other broader changes to the regulatory capital framework, would increase bank incentives to engage in mortgage origination and servicing. First, the proposals would remove the requirement to deduct mortgage servicing assets from regulatory capital while maintaining the 250 percent risk weight assigned to these assets. We will seek comment on the appropriate risk weight for these assets. This change in the treatment of mortgage servicing assets would encourage bank participation in the mortgage servicing business while recognizing uncertainty regarding the value of these assets over the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Second, the proposals would also consider increasing the risk sensitivity of capital requirements for mortgage loans on bank books. One approach would be to use loan-to-value ratios to determine the applicable risk weight for residential real estate exposures, rather than applying a uniform risk weight regardless of LTV. This change could better align capital requirements with actual risk, support on-balance-sheet lending by banks, and potentially reverse the trend of migration of mortgage activity to nonbanks over the past 15 years.</p>
<p>These potential changes would address legitimate concerns about mortgage market structure while maintaining appropriate prudential safeguards. I look forward to receiving feedback from industry and other stakeholders as we consider these modifications.</p>
<p><span>Closing Thoughts</span><br />By creating a resilient mortgage market that includes robust participation from all types of financial institutions, we can deliver affordable credit and high-quality servicing to borrowers regardless of economic conditions. Strengthening bank participation in these activities does not threaten the safety and soundness of the banking system. These goals are consistent.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with my fellow regulators to consider options for creating pathways to return banks to their traditional and core business services, including in the retail mortgage space.</p>
<p>Thank you again for the invitation to join you today, and I look forward to our discussion.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Former Chief Executive Of Carillion Plc (In Liquidation)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has fined Richard Howson &pound;237,700 for his part in misleading statements being issued by Carillion plc.</p>
<p><span>As group chief executive, Mr Howson was aware of serious financial troubles in Carillion&rsquo;s UK construction business. He failed to reflect this in company announcements or alert its board and audit committee, leading to poor oversight.</span></p>
<p><span>The fine was imposed after Mr Howson withdrew his challenge to the FCA&rsquo;s decision.</span></p>
<p><span>Mr Howson was one of two executive directors on Carillion&rsquo;s Board. His responsibilities included working closely with the group finance director (the other executive director on the board) to ensure Carillion communicated effectively with investors and had appropriate internal control processes. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Primary responsibility for ensuring the financial information disseminated to the market was accurate and not misleading lay with the group finance director. However, Mr Howson played an important role as the Board member with the most expertise on construction and contracting matters.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The FCA found that Mr Howson acted recklessly and was knowingly concerned in breaches by Carillion of the Market Abuse Regulation and the Listing Rules.</span></p>
<p><span>Steve Smart, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:</span></p>
<p><span>'Carillion&rsquo;s failure was significant. Jobs were lost, public sector projects put at risk and investors, who trusted the company to give them accurate information, suffered large scale losses. That&rsquo;s why the FCA worked diligently to hold the company and its senior leaders to account.'</span></p>
<p><span>During the period in question, Carillion&rsquo;s group finance director was first Richard Adam and then Zafar Khan. They were fined &pound;232,800 and &pound;138,900, respectively, in January 2026.</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Article 15 of MAR (prohibition of market manipulation) by disseminating information that gave false or misleading signals as to the value of its shares in circumstances where it ought to have known that the information was false or misleading.</li>
<li>Listing Rule 1.3.3R (misleading information must not be published) by failing to take reasonable care to ensure that its announcements were not misleading, false or deceptive and did not omit anything likely to affect the import of the information.</li>
<li>Listing Principle 1 (procedures, systems and controls) by failing to take reasonable steps to establish and maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to comply with its obligations under the Listing Rules; and</li>

<title>Nasdaq Dubai Posts Strongest Year On Record With Outstanding Sukuk Value Surpassing USD 100 Billion</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><i>Since inception, Nasdaq Dubai has listed more than USD 245 billion in cumulative bonds and Sukuk issuances, including USD 177 billion in Sukuk.</i></li>
<li><i>Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s Sukuk market has achieved an eightfold increase since 2013. Supported by robust international issuances, outstanding listings have climbed from USD 12.6 billion to over USD 100 billion.</i></li>
<li><i>Total value of outstanding debt securities listed across DFM and Nasdaq Dubai reached USD 150.9 billion in 2025, with Nasdaq Dubai accounting for USD 146.1 billion.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai attracted a record number of Sukuk listings in 2025, supported by sustained issuance activity from regional and international issuers and continued global investor demand for Sharia-compliant debt instruments.</p>
<p>By the end of 2025, the total value of outstanding debt securities listed across Dubai Financial Market (DFM) and Nasdaq Dubai reached USD 150.9 billion, with Nasdaq Dubai accounting for USD 146.1 billion of the total.</p>
<p>The exchange&rsquo;s Sukuk market has expanded significantly over the past decade, with the value of outstanding listings increasing eightfold since 2013, from USD 12.6 billion to more than USD 100 billion. Since inception, Nasdaq Dubai has hosted more than USD 245 billion in cumulative bonds and Sukuk issuances, including USD 177 billion in Sukuk.</p>
<p>The growth aligns with the United Arab Emirates&rsquo; National Strategy for Islamic Finance and Halal Industry, which targets Islamic banking assets of AED 2.56 trillion and aims to increase Sukuk listings to more than AED 660 billion domestically and AED 395 billion internationally by 2031.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><b>Record Listings Activity in 2025</b></p>
<p>In 2025, Nasdaq Dubai recorded USD 30.6 billion in new debt listings across 60 issuances, marking record levels of strong and diversified listings activity. Debuts from Ajman Bank, OMNIYAT, Mashreq, China Development Bank and the New Development Bank, alongside repeat issuances under established programmes, further strengthened the exchange&rsquo;s continued appeal to sovereign, supranational, financial and corporate issuers.</p>
<p>Sovereign and government-related issuers continued to represent a significant share of activity during the year. Issuances by the Republic of Indonesia, the UAE Federal Government, and the governments of Ras Al Khaimah and Sharjah reinforced Dubai&rsquo;s standing as a trusted gateway for global capital flows. Corporate and financial institution issuers also listed a diverse range of instruments, spanning conventional bonds, Sukuk, Additional Tier 1 capital securities, and sustainability-linked structures, highlighting the depth and flexibility of Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s fixed income market.</p>
<p><b>Leadership in Sustainable Finance</b></p>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai advanced its position as a regional leader in sustainable finance during 2025. By year-end, the total outstanding value of ESG-linked debt instruments listed on the exchange reached USD 30.08 billion across 41 issuances. This included:</p>
<ul>
<li>USD 18.38      billion in green bonds across 27 issuances</li>
<li>USD 9.05      billion in sustainability bonds across 9 issuances</li>
<li>USD 2.55      billion in sustainability-linked bonds across 4 issuances</li>
<li>USD 100      million blue bond across 1 issuance</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Global Gateway for International Issuers</b></p>
<p>Global issuer participation has been a defining pillar of Nasdaq Dubai&rsquo;s growth. Over the years, the exchange has attracted landmark debt listings from sovereign, supranational and institutional issuers across Asia and the Middle East, reflecting sustained international confidence in its market infrastructure. Sovereign issuers such as the Governments of Indonesia, Turkey, China, Hong Kong, Philippines, and supranationals including Islamic Development Bank, Islamic Corporation for the Development of the Private Sector and New Development Bank as well as a Policy Bank like China Development Bank, have chosen Nasdaq Dubai as their listing venue, underscoring its role as a trusted international gateway for cross-border debt and sukuk issuance.</p>
<p><b>Abdul Wahed Al Fahim, Chairman of Nasdaq Dubai</b>, said: &ldquo;2025 has been a milestone year for Nasdaq Dubai. Surpassing USD 100 billion in outstanding Sukuk listings and achieving record levels of debt issuance reflects the strong confidence placed in our market by issuers and investors worldwide. These milestones underscore Dubai&rsquo;s position as a trusted, globally connected hub for Islamic finance, fixed income and sustainable investment.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM)</b>, said: &ldquo;Crossing USD 100 billion in outstanding Sukuk listings is a landmark achievement for Nasdaq Dubai and reflects the strong and sustained confidence of international and domestic issuers in our market. This momentum was supported in 2025 by USD 30.6 billion in new debt listings across 60 issuances, underscoring our role as a leading international listing venue for Sukuk and fixed income instruments. As we look ahead, our focus remains on deepening global connectivity, expanding multi-currency and ESG Sukuk offerings, and attracting new issuers from emerging and frontier markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Building on a record-breaking year and historic milestones achieved in 2025, Nasdaq Dubai enters 2026 with continued activity across Sukuk, ESG and multi-currency debt instruments. The exchange remains focused on supporting issuers and investors through a diversified fixed income offering, contributing to Dubai&rsquo;s capital markets ecosystem and reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading global hub for fixed income and Islamic finance.</p>

<title>New German Law To Ease Market Access For Foreign Market Makers, Boosting Eurex</title>

<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>New German law exempts non-EU market makers from licensing rules.</li>
<li>Reform is set to increase liquidity and competition on Eurex.</li>
<li>The change follows long-standing Eurex efforts to lower market access barriers.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eurex, Europe's leading derivatives exchange, today highlights a significant enhancement of access to its markets following the enactment of Germany's Financial Centre Promotion Act ("Standortf&ouml;rdergesetz"). The new legislation refines the regulatory framework applicable to third country Regulatory Market-Makers (RMMs), a move that will reduce entry barriers, boost international participation, and increase liquidity in the European derivatives market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Effective immediately, the legislation exempts RMMs based outside the European Union from the previous requirement to establish a physical entity or seek an individual exemption in Germany. This reform streamlines the process for providing liquidity on German-regulated exchanges like Eurex, eliminating what was a significant operational and financial hurdle for many global firms.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new framework is set to enhance market efficiency, increase competition, and reduce bureaucracy. The reform addresses barriers that Eurex, as part of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, has consistently worked with market participants and policymakers to highlight as crucial for strengthening Germany's position as a leading global financial hub and ensuring a level playing field with other major European jurisdictions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Robbert Booij, CEO of Eurex: "This is a landmark development that directly reflects our long-term strategy of lowering access barriers and boosting liquidity. By removing a significant regulatory hurdle, we are opening the door for additional liquidity providers to access our exchange. This is not just a win for Eurex, but for all market participants who will benefit from more efficient and competitive markets."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This legislative enhancement is a key component of Eurex's broader commitment to market accessibility. It complements established initiatives such as the Sponsored Access model and comprehensive liquidity provider programs, all designed to foster global participation and improve market efficiency. Eurex is now actively engaging with firms in the UK, Switzerland, North America, and Asia to ensure they can swiftly capitalize on this new opportunity to access Europe's leading derivatives markets.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Its Final Guidelines On Proportionate Retail Diversification Methods Under The Standardised Approach For Credit Risk</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-its-final-guidelines-on-proportionate-retail-diversification-m-2026213/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-its-final-guidelines-on-proportionate-retail-diversification-m-2026213/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Guidelines on proportionate retail diversification methods under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The Guidelines provide a harmonised framework to assess whether their retail portfolios are sufficiently diversified, while ensuring a proportionate application for smaller institutions.</span></p>
<p>To benefit for the preferential 75% risk weight for retail exposures, the Guidelines outline an approach whereby institutions demonstrate that retail portfolios are sufficiently granular. As a starting point, no single exposure to a counterparty or group of connected clients should exceed 0.2% of the total eligible retail portfolio.</p>
<p>Recognising that not all institutions, particularly smaller ones, can consistently meet this benchmark, the Guidelines introduce an additional approach: institutions may still apply the preferential risk weight even if they exceed the baseline benchmark, provided that no more than 10% of their eligible retail portfolio is above the 0.2% threshold.</p>
<p>In the consultation paper, the EBA presented two alternative approaches for assessing diversification: an iterative method proposed as the baseline option, and a one-step alternative. In the final Guidelines, the EBA opted for the one-step approach to ensure proportionality and reduce the operational burden for institutions. The diversification threshold has also been raised from 5% to 10% compared with the consultation proposal, reflecting industry feedback and easing the impact on small and medium-sized institutions while maintaining sound prudential safeguards.</p>
<p>The Guidelines also clarify the treatment of securitised retail exposures, distinguishing between the diversification assessment applicable when institutions act as originators and when they act as investors. For investor institutions, a limited and temporary derogation is introduced when obligor‑level information is not available under the applicable transparency templates, allowing the diversification condition to be deemed fulfilled.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The Guidelines have been developed pursuant to Article 123(1) of Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 (CRR), which mandates the EBA to specify proportionate diversification methods for retail exposures under the Standardised Approach for credit risk.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>This Statement describes, among other things, my remarks and other matters discussed by Duc Dang, Sebastian Gomez Abero, Jonathan Ingram, Heather Rosenberger, and Ted Yu during various presentations at the 2026 Securities Regulation Institute from January 26-28, 2026, in Coronado, California.</em><a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1"><em>[1]</em></a></p>
<p>Steven Spielberg is directing a movie called&nbsp;<em>Disclosure Day</em>, coming this summer to a theater near you. As I keep telling my team, the changes you will see emerge from the Securities and Exchange Commission by way of the Division of Corporation Finance (the &ldquo;Division&rdquo;) will be the equivalent of a series of blockbuster movies, reminiscent of Spielberg&rsquo;s greatest hits. He may have already taken the perfect title for one of our movies, but you can expect our very own &ldquo;disclosure day&rdquo; releases. And while Spielberg and I have very different plots in mind for our productions, I promise you that our releases will be just as thrilling. It&rsquo;s time to leave some of these burdensome regulations on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>I rejoined the Commission&rsquo;s staff a few short months ago after nearly a quarter century in private practice, ready to implement Chairman Paul Atkins&rsquo; sweeping agenda to return the agency to its core mission of protecting investors and facilitating capital formation. The intent of his agenda is to reduce barriers to going public, rationalize burdensome requirements while ensuring that investors continue to have access to the material information they need, and simplify and modernize our rules so that more companies are willing to go and stay public. The Division will play a starring role in executing that agenda. Just take a look at the long list of Division rulemakings on the Regulatory Flexibility Agenda.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The Division staff is currently working on advancing our rulemakings as quickly as possible. In line with the Chairman&rsquo;s priorities, we are first focusing on crypto assets reform, implementing the Holding Foreign Insiders Accountable Act (&ldquo;HFIAA&rdquo;) to require Section 16 reporting for Foreign Private Issuers (&ldquo;FPIs&rdquo;) as mandated by Congress, creating an option for semi-annual, rather than quarterly, reporting, and reducing regulatory burdens from Regulation S-K, including executive compensation disclosures.</p>
<h3>Crypto Assets</h3>
<p>Last year, then-Acting Chairman Mark Uyeda referenced Spielberg&rsquo;s first blockbuster,&nbsp;<em>Jaws</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>in his remarks at the SEC Speaks conference.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;He described a dangerous sea with the ever-lurking threat of regulation by enforcement. In the prior administration, nowhere was that more evident than in crypto assets enforcement.</p>
<p>Two of the Division&rsquo;s blockbuster recommendations headed to the Commission will focus on crypto assets. Last November, Chairman Atkins outlined the next steps for &ldquo;Project Crypto,&rdquo; which he expects will provide a clear taxonomy for crypto assets and guidance on when crypto assets are no longer part of, or subject to, an investment contract.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref4"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a>&nbsp;The Division is preparing to deliver these recommendations to the Commission in the form of interpretive guidance that provides a taxonomy for crypto assets and describes a framework for determining when crypto assets are subject to an investment contract. For those crypto assets that are subject to an investment contract, we are also working on a proposal that will seek to provide a rational regulatory structure for the offer and sale of those securities.</p>
<p>Following these big releases, the markets will no doubt continue to innovate. You&rsquo;ve seen that the Division has been willing to jump in and has provided needed market clarity through Division statements and no-action letters.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref5"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;We will continue to monitor the marketplace and provide additional guidance as needed to further facilitate capital formation and accommodate innovation in this space without sacrificing investor protection.</p>

<p>Securities lawyers from the early days of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 would want to &ldquo;phone home&rdquo; if they were transported,&nbsp;<em>E.T.</em>-style, to witness today&rsquo;s disclosure regime. The overall length of proxy statements and periodic filings &ndash; not to mention compliance costs &ndash; have skyrocketed over the past decades, creating massive documents that would be alien to those who created our disclosure regime. To invigorate the process of right-sizing these disclosures, the Chairman recently put out a statement instructing the Division to review Regulation S-K with the goal of &ldquo;revising the requirements to focus on eliciting disclosure of material information and avoid compelling the disclosure of immaterial information.&rdquo;<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref6"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a>&nbsp;The Chairman&rsquo;s statement requested public comment on any part of Regulation S-K, following upon the informative Executive Compensation Roundtable and related request for comment last year focused on Item 402 of Regulation S-K.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref7"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Companies, investors, and other market participants now have the unique opportunity to help us draft the scripts for the next several sequels. We have plenty of long academic letters about the principles of disclosure, but we are looking for targeted, concrete recommendations to reduce immaterial disclosure and encourage companies to focus on the information that is material to investors. The Division can especially use data, including but not limited to the cost of compliance with specific SEC rules. Go ahead and mark up the reg text itself &ndash; we aren&rsquo;t afraid of some red ink on our script. Please feel free to submit your comments on Regulation S-X as well.</p>
<h3>Semi-Annual Reporting</h3>
<p>It may feel as though we&rsquo;re still stuck in&nbsp;<em>The Terminal&nbsp;</em>with semi-annual reporting. President Trump initially called for an end to quarterly reporting in a social media post in 2018, and the SEC followed up with a request for comment, but unfortunately nothing materialized at the time.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref8"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;In September 2025, the President again called for a reconsideration of mandatory quarterly reporting. This time, however, I expect things will be different. Chairman Atkins has asked us to prioritize this proposal.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref9"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s time to leave the airport at last and travel forward with a formal rulemaking. As we prepare recommendations for the Commission, we will be considering what other rule changes may be needed to ensure any transition to a semi-annual reporting process will be smooth and free from any regulatory turbulence.</p>
<p>Like selecting the perfect travel snack once in the air, there&rsquo;s no one-size-fits-all solution. For some companies and their investors, semi-annual reporting may make sense. Other companies, however, may have reasons why quarterly reporting still works best for them. We want to hear a broad range of market participants&rsquo; thoughts on the best way to structure the final rule before making the Division&rsquo;s ultimate recommendation to the Commission.</p>
<p>If you have any data (including from other jurisdictions) on the possible effects of changing the reporting cycle, please send us that information through the comment process once a rule proposal is out.</p>
<h3>HFIAA and Concept Releases</h3>
<p>As in&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones</em>, distant foreign lands offer unexpected changes, excitement, and adventure. As part of the 2026 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress passed the HFIAA. The HFIAA subjects the directors and officers of reporting FPIs to the SEC&rsquo;s insider transaction reporting regime and mandates that the SEC implement any necessary rule changes by March 18, 2026.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref10"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Unlike some of the mazes that challenged the intrepid explorer Indiana Jones, Congress gave us a clear map to guide us for what needs to be done in short order. And, like Indy, we are racing ahead of a rolling boulder&nbsp;&ndash; in this case, the March 18, 2026, deadline to complete the mandated rulemaking.</p>
<p>The Division is working to get its rulemaking recommendations to the Commission ahead of the deadline. Still, it&rsquo;s important to keep in mind that the Exchange Act Section 16(a) amendments made by the HFIAA are self-executing, so, regardless of the rulemaking&rsquo;s status, officers and directors of reporting FPIs must comply with the Section 16(a) reporting obligations beginning March 18, 2026. Our EDGAR Business Office recently put out a message recommending that directors and officers of FPIs request their filer identification numbers early so that there are not thousands of requests rushing in right before the deadline comes crashing down.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref11"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>The HFIAA gave the Commission the authority to exempt directors and officers of reporting FPIs in jurisdictions in which the applicable foreign law requirements are &ldquo;substantially similar&rdquo; to Section 16(a). Division staff is analyzing the laws of foreign jurisdictions and may make recommendations to the Commission in this area.</p>
<p>FPIs also have a starring role in our June 2025&nbsp;Concept Release on Foreign Private Issuer Eligibility.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref12"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;The Division is processing the comments received thus far on that release. And don&rsquo;t forget our September 2025 Concept Release on Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Disclosures and Enhancements to Asset-Backed Securities Registration.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref13"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a>&nbsp;The comment period for that release recently closed and we&rsquo;re wrapping up our review of comments received to date in preparation for making a recommendation to the Commission about a potential rule proposal.</p>
<h3>Staff Guidance and More</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect a quiet summer ahead as we continue our work on an extensive overhaul of our rules to implement regulatory reform. Nowadays, in between the flashy blockbuster sequels, you can watch a steady stream of good shows that help move the plot along to keep pace with the market. Between the big rulemakings that I just described, we will be issuing staff-level guidance that will continue to help companies, their advisors, investors, and other market participants more efficiently navigate our rules. The Division has been putting out interpretive guidance and no-action letters on a variety of topics, including tender offers, broker searches, exempt proxy solicitations, spin-offs, crypto assets, and Section 13(d) group formation. You can expect to see even more staff guidance in the near future. We want to do what we can to assist registrants and smooth the path to capital formation without sacrificing investor protection.</p>
<h3>Disclosure Review</h3>
<p>Some movie franchises have a seemingly endless number of sequels and remakes. Our Disclosure Review Program&rsquo;s prolific output dwarfs the number of<em>&nbsp;Jurassic Park</em>&nbsp;films. After receiving nearly 1,000 registration statements during the Fall 2025 government shutdown (with more flowing in after the shutdown ended), the Disclosure Review Program triaged filings and processed them as quickly as possible in the order received. Lapse times are still a bit longer than usual, but they are trending downward as the program resumes normal operations.</p>
<p>I am proud of our updated shutdown guidance related to Rule 430A that allowed issuers greater flexibility with respect to pricing offerings that were filed without a delaying amendment.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref14"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;Some of these offerings went effective automatically after the passage of 20 days. Remember that you won&rsquo;t see notices of effectiveness on EDGAR for registration statements that went automatically effective. Those notices are only issued when the staff declares a registration statement effective by delegated authority. There has also been a delay in posting comment letters due to the dig-out from the shutdown, so keep in mind that the number of letters and correspondence posted may not yet reflect what was actually finalized over the last few months. If you have any questions, your review team stands ready to assist.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Proposals</h3>
<p>Speaking of sequels, the shareholder proposals task force is taking a much-needed break after decades of proxy proposal review seasons. The Division&rsquo;s November statement pausing the task force due to resource constraints has led to a number of questions and practical approaches taken by proponents and companies alike.<a class="ck-anchor" id="_ftnref15"></a><a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/moloney-statement-coming-attractions-021326-coming-attractions-division-corporation-finance?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a>&nbsp;We have been doing a lot of outreach to companies, investors, and proxy advisors to answer questions and listen to concerns.</p>
<p>We are seeing a mixed result so far, with over 150 no-objection letter requests received, while other proposals are included in company proxy statements. We aren&rsquo;t putting a thumb on the outcome scale either way, so we aren&rsquo;t surprised to see companies reaching different conclusions based on the details of the proposals, independent legal analysis, and their own business and risk assessments. A rulemaking to modernize the shareholder proposals rule is on the Commission&rsquo;s agenda and the Division is in the process of preparing its recommendations.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Under my leadership, there is an open-door policy in the Division. I invite companies, investors, and other market participants to tell us what&rsquo;s working and what&rsquo;s not, and where there are issues, please propose a solution. The Division is ready to usher in a new day for public companies and their investors. We need your ideas, suggestions, comments, and data to get there. Help us help you!</p>
<p>Then grab a seat and your popcorn before the feature films start rolling. Exciting times lie ahead!</p>

<title>Trading Technologies Wins Multi-Asset Trading System Of The Year For TT® Platform At FOW International Awards 2026 - Former TT CEO Keith Todd Honored With Lifetime Achievement Award</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Trading Technologies International, Inc. (TT), a global capital markets technology platform services provider, last night won Multi-Asset Trading System of the Year for its TT platform at the FOW International Awards 2026.</p>
<p>The awards, presented at a dinner ceremony in London last night, also honored Keith Todd, who served as CEO of TT from December 2021 to March 2025, with a Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
<p>The FOW International Awards celebrate excellence, innovation and leadership across the global derivatives industry, spotlighting firms and individuals whose achievements are "redefining the future of derivatives." Award winners were chosen by an independent panel of experts from throughout the industry. The Lifetime Achievement Award was selected by the editorial team of Futures &amp; Options World (FOW).</p>
<p>Comments from the judges included: "TT have been the gold standard for more than 20 years, and continue to innovate, both with new exchange offerings to the main trading functionality and the host of new functions coming online since the 7RIDGE deal."</p>
<p>TT CEO Justin Llewellyn-Jones said: "We've worked diligently over the past four years to ensure we built on the capabilities of our leading derivatives platform to meet the growing multi-asset needs of our clients across the trade life cycle. It's gratifying to earn the global recognition of Multi-Asset Trading System of the Year in such short order. We are also delighted that FOW has recognized the extraordinary contributions of Keith Todd, who put into place our multi-asset strategy when he assumed the CEO role in late 2021. Congratulations to Keith on this well-deserved honor."</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury Accepting Whistleblower Tips On Fraud, Money Laundering, Sanctions Violations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today launched a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/whistleblower/">new dedicated webpage</a>&nbsp;to confidentially accept whistleblower tips on fraud, money laundering, and sanctions violations. While in Minnesota last month in support of President Trump&rsquo;s efforts to stop the rampant government benefits fraud schemes, which have cost taxpayers billions of dollars, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent&nbsp;<a class="external" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/treasury-secretary-announces-cash-rewards-minnesota-fraud-whistleblowers">announced</a>&nbsp;that Treasury would provide financial rewards for eligible whistleblower tips.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Minnesota, Secretary Bessent also&nbsp;<a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0354">unveiled</a>&nbsp;a series of initiatives Treasury is undertaking to combat fraud, including investigating Money Services Businesses, enhancing reporting to accelerate prosecutions and recover laundered funds, alerting financial institutions to help disrupt fraud rings exploiting child nutrition programs, and training law enforcement to better leverage financial data to combat complex fraud schemes. In addition, the IRS will launch a dedicated fraud task force focused on targeting the misuse of funding by 501(c)(3) tax-exempt&nbsp;entities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;President Trump has been clear that Americans have a right to know that their tax dollars are not being diverted to fund acts of global terror or to fund luxury cars for fraudsters. At Treasury, we follow the money. We did it with the mafia, we have done it with the cartels, and we&rsquo;re doing it with the Somali fraudsters,&rdquo; said Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent. &ldquo;We are going to offer whistleblower payments to anyone who wants to tell us the who, what, when, where, and how this fraud and money laundering has occurred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FinCEN&rsquo;s Office of the Whistleblower is accepting tips involving violations and conspiracies related to the Bank Secrecy Act, U.S. sanctions programs, and several other laws critical to safeguarding the U.S. financial system and national security. Individuals who provide information may be eligible for awards if their tip leads to a successful enforcement action.</p>
<p>Whistleblowers are encouraged to submit information as soon as possible and to provide detailed, specific documentation to support their claims. For more information on FinCEN&rsquo;s whistleblower program and how to submit tips, visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fincen.gov/whistleblower/">fincen.gov/whistleblower</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that ICE&rsquo;s interest rate derivatives markets hit record open interest (OI) of 42.3 million contracts on February 11, 2026, up 45% year-over-year (y/y), as ICE&rsquo;s total OI across its futures and options markets hit a record 116.5 million.</p>
<p>ICE SONIA futures and options - the benchmark for managing U.K. interest rate risk - hit record OI of 15.4 million on February 11, 2026, including a record 11.7 million SONIA options, with OI up 63% and 70% respectively. In January 2025, a record 8.9 million SONIA options traded during the month, with record average daily volume of 426,000 contracts.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE&rsquo;s MPC Dated SONIA futures, a cash settled future based on the interest rate accrued over a Bank of England Monetary Policy Meeting period, is seeing increased use by market participants who want to more precisely trade around central bank meeting dates, utilizing the margin offsets available when trading and clearing alongside ICE SONIA. On January 29, 2026, OI in MPC Dated SONIA futures surpassed 51,000 contracts for the first time.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, OI across Gilts, the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve, is up 21% at 1.2 million contracts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the only global exchange to offer a multi-currency rates portfolio, customers are benefiting from the diversity and deep liquidity of ICE&rsquo;s benchmark U.K. and EU rates markets as they respond to shifting monetary policy paths and cross-market signals,&rdquo; said Caterina Caramaschi, VP of Financial Derivatives at ICE. &ldquo;The record open interest reflects the value customers find in using a single platform to align exposure across assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to U.K. rates, ICE is home to Euribor, the benchmark for managing short term euro-related interest rate risk, with OI of 22.7 million across futures and options, up 33% y/y; as well as &euro;STR, which reflects the wholesale euro unsecured overnight borrowing costs of banks located in the euro area, with futures OI of 2.2 million, up over 100% y/y; and SARON, the Swiss benchmark, with OI up 16% y/y.</p>

<p>The Governor began the meeting by thanking attendees for joining and reminding participants of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/markets/market-intelligence/participants-group#:~:text=The%20group%27s%20objectives%20are%20to">purpose</a>&nbsp;of these meetings.

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">Item 2 &ndash; International developments</h3>
<p>Market participants discussed the outlook for the global economy and developments in financial markets since the start of the year. A positive global growth picture continued to support risk sentiment, with evidence of some rotation into European and Asian assets. Geopolitical concerns remained a source of volatility, including in precious metals. There had been record corporate issuance in January and credit spreads remained tight reflecting strong demand. Market participants also discussed developments in AI, including its potential impact on productivity, capital investment, employment and prices &ndash; but acknowledged significant uncertainty around the timing and magnitude of these impacts, and across different countries and industries.</p>
<p>The discussion moved on to the emerging evidence of the impact of tariffs, trade policy uncertainty and trade diversion on global prices and their relevance to the UK, where market participants had a range of views. Market participants concluded by identifying relevant risks to the outlook, including the potential for a correction in asset valuations as well as continued fiscal sustainability pressures globally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">Item 3 &ndash; Domestic developments</h3>
<p>Market participants shared their reactions to the February MPC meeting. Although the policy outcome was as expected, market participants highlighted the finely balanced nature of the vote split and associated communications as driving a dovish market reaction. This had seen market pricing for the near-term path of Bank Rate move lower. Considering the UK market curve further out, market participants highlighted the role of term premium in explaining the upward sloping nature of the yield curve towards the end of the forecast horizon, which they did not interpret as reflecting expectations for increases in Bank Rate. Market participants noted that term premium reflected a range of factors but was broadly characterised as remunerating investors for uncertainty.</p>
<p>Market participants expressed a range of opinions on the UK macroeconomic outlook, and on the prevailing degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy. Some market participants considered that signs of weaker growth and employment could have been driven by sources of uncertainty which may now be abating, and that wage inflation was at a level above that which they would consider consistent with achieving the inflation target. Other market participants assigned more weight to evidence of subdued economic growth, a rising unemployment rate, and other measures of labour market weakness. This range of views had led market participants to differing conclusions about the appropriate setting and path for Bank Rate.</p>

<title>Cboe Launches Nearly 24-Hour Trading In Russell 2000 Index Options</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Cash-settled Russell 2000&reg; Index (RUT) options now available during Cboe's Global Trading Hours</li>
<li>Cboe now offers nearly 24x5 trading for RUT, S&amp;P 500 Index and Cboe Volatility Index options</li>
<li>RUT options and Cboe's Global Trading Hours both reached record volumes in 2025</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe:&nbsp;CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced Russell 2000 Index (RUT) and Russell 2000 Index Weeklys (RUTW) options are now available to trade on the Cboe Options Exchange nearly 24 hours a day, five days a week.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>The addition of RUT options to Cboe's Global Trading Hours (GTH) session offers European and Asia Pacific investors the ability to better manage U.S. small-cap exposure and trade during their local daytime hours. Cboe also offers S&amp;P 500 Index (SPX), Mini-SPX (XSP) and Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) options during its GTH session, which experienced record volumes in 2025, up 27% compared to 2024.</p>
<p>RUT options saw record demand as investors increasingly turned to cash-settled, European-style options to help manage positioning and implement a broad range of trading strategies. Retail and institutional investors typically utilize RUT options to hedge or express market views, generate yield, or implement zero-days-to-expiry (0DTE) positions. In January, 0DTE trading represented 23% of total RUT options activity, reflecting growing investor demand for short-dated strategies.</p>
<p>"Cboe remains steadfast in our efforts to expand global access to U.S. markets and empower investors with the flexibility and tools they need to manage today's market environment," said Rob Hocking, Global Head of Derivatives at Cboe. "Demand for Russell 2000 Index options remained elevated as market participants navigated uncertainty, looked to diversify exposure and sought the utility index options can provide. By offering nearly 24-hour RUT trading alongside our SPX and VIX options, global investors can better act on their strategies in real time, regardless of time zone." &nbsp;</p>
<p>Milan Galik, Chief Executive Officer of Interactive Brokers, said: "Interactive Brokers is committed to expanding trading hours across the wide scope of asset classes we offer to our global clientele, as soon as and wherever such expansion is possible. With exchanges like Cboe now enabling 24/5 trading for Russell 2000 Index options, our clients worldwide gain the ability to manage their small-cap options positions around the clock and respond to international market developments in real-time."&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shawn Creighton, Director of Index Derivatives Solutions at FTSE Russell, said: "Cboe's decision to introduce nearly 24-hour trading for Russell 2000 Index options is a significant milestone for global investors. As a key benchmark for U.S. small-cap equities, the expansion of Russell 2000 Index options will now offer investors enhanced flexibility to capture opportunities across time zones."</p>
<p>On February 25 at 12:30 p.m. ET, Cboe will host a webinar featuring Mandy Xu, Head of Derivatives Market Intelligence at Cboe, and Catherine Yoshimoto, Director of Product Management at FTSE Russell. The discussion will cover the expansion of RUT trading hours, recent RUT options trading trends, and the outlook for small-cap performance and volatility. Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4619371-1&amp;h=2319429638&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.cboe.com%2Fmarket-intelligence-content-subscription&amp;a=here" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;to sign up to receive webinar registration details and additional Cboe derivatives insights and analysis.</p>
<p>RUT and RUTW options now trade Monday through Friday during Cboe's Regular Trading Hours (RTH) (9:30 a.m. ET to 4:15 p.m. ET), Global Trading Hours (GTH) (8:15 p.m. ET to 9:25 a.m. ET) and Curb Trading Hours (4:15 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET).</p>

<title>Statement On Jury’s Verdict In Trial Of Ismael Sanchez: Margaret Ryan, Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement, Feb. 12, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, after a four-day trial, a jury in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas found defendant Ismael Sanchez liable for securities fraud and registration violations.</p>
<p>As shown at trial, Defendant Sanchez was a lead salesperson for CryptoFX, a large-scale Ponzi scheme that targeted approximately 40,000 investors by promising to trade investor funds in the crypto asset and foreign exchange markets, but in reality used investor money to make Ponzi payments, pay commissions to salespeople, and fund personal expenses. The office in Chicago that Sanchez led raised tens of millions of dollars from investors. The jury found Sanchez liable for securities fraud and registration failures under the federal securities laws.</p>
<p><span>Statement of SEC Enforcement Director Margaret A. Ryan:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased with the jury verdict holding Mr. Sanchez liable for fraud and other violations for his role in soliciting retail investors to put their money into this egregious Ponzi scheme. This action demonstrates our ongoing commitment to our core mission of protecting investors and holding wrongdoers accountable. I thank the trial team for its hard work and professionalism in trying this case.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Releases Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test Scenarios For 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) released economic and financial market scenarios for use in the upcoming stress tests for covered institutions.</p>
<p>The supervisory scenarios include baseline and severely adverse scenarios. Covered institutions are required to use the scenarios to conduct stress tests. The results of the company-run stress tests provide the OCC with forward-looking information used in bank supervision and assist the agency in assessing a covered institution&rsquo;s risk profile and capital adequacy.</p>
<p>Section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, requires certain financial companies, including certain national banks and federal savings associations, to conduct periodic stress tests.</p>
<p>The 2026 scenario and background information can be found on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.occ.treas.gov/publications-and-resources/forms/dodd-frank-act-stress-test/index-dodd-frank-act-stress-test.html" title="Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run)">OCC&rsquo;s Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (Company Run) page</a>. The final policy statement on the development and distribution of the scenarios was issued on October 28, 2013, in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Publishes 2025 Systemic Risk Committee Annual Report</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-publishes-2025-systemic-risk-committee-annual-2026212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-publishes-2025-systemic-risk-committee-annual-2026212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published its 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/csa-systemic-risk-committee/2025-annual-report-on-capital-markets/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Systemic Risk Committee Annual Report on Capital Markets</a>&nbsp;&ndash; an analysis of recent financial market trends, emerging risk areas, and potential vulnerabilities in Canadian capital markets. The report also outlines some of the CSA&rsquo;s efforts to mitigate those vulnerabilities and associated risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 2025 report comes at a significant moment for Canada in the global context,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, CSA Chair and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;At a time of uncertainty, when markets are looking for stability, the CSA is setting out its analysis of current and emerging risks, to help our market participants and investors navigate these complex times.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite heightened economic and financial uncertainty, the Canadian financial system remained resilient in 2025. Trade conflict slowed the economy, especially in the manufacturing sector, and uncertainty remains relatively high. However, economic growth has been stronger than initially expected.</p>
<p>The report highlights a rise in the use of artificial intelligence, potentially impacting financial stability due to a concentration of firms creating third-party dependencies for the financial system. Moreover, heavy reliance on a few AI models could negatively impact liquidity conditions and volatility.</p>
<p>The report notes the growing role stablecoins play in the crypto ecosystem and the risks posed by high market concentration. In 2025, the United States adopted the GENIUS Act and Canada introduced legislation to regulate issuance of fiat-based stablecoins. Despite rapid growth, the CSA does not see stablecoins currently presenting a systemic risk, though global regulatory coordination is essential in managing any potential risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other key trends and vulnerabilities analysed in the report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rising clearing activity for derivatives and repurchase agreements</li>
<li>The potential impact of trade tensions on non-financial corporate bonds</li>
<li>Stable liquidity in Canadian fixed-income markets</li>
<li>Over-the-counter derivatives developments</li>
<li>Private asset fund liquidity challenges</li>
</ul>
<p>To read the report and learn more about the initiatives carried out by the CSA Systemic Risk Committee, please visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/csa-systemic-risk-committee/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CSA website</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA created its Systemic Risk Committee in the wake of the global financial crisis as the principal forum for CSA staff to analyze and monitor systemic and emerging risks. In 2022, the committee launched an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/csa-activities/csa-systemic-risk-committee/2025-csa-systemic-risk-survey/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">annual systemic risk survey</a>&nbsp;that solicits views on financial risks from market participants as part of its efforts to deliver on its mandate.</p>
<p>The CSA also collaborates with other agencies at the federal and provincial levels to ensure appropriate monitoring of emerging and systemic risks and the development of mitigation strategies where appropriate. Notably, CSA members engage with these agencies both directly and through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/financial-system/financial-system-committees/heads-regulatory-agencies-terms-of-reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heads of Regulatory Agencies Committee</a>&nbsp;and its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/financial-system/financial-system-committees/systemic-risk-surveillance-committee-terms-of-reference/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Systemic Risk Surveillance Committee</a>.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<title>ECB And ESRB Issue Joint Report Analysing Financial Stability Risks From Linkages Between Banks And The Non-Bank Financial Intermediation Sector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Interconnections between EU banks and the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector can give rise to systemic risks</li>
<li>Systemic risks stem from concentrated short-term funding from NBFI entities to banks and bank lending to leveraged NBFI entities</li>
<li>Granular data are crucial to assess bank-NBFI linkages, but data gaps constrain analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) and the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) today published a joint report entitled &ldquo;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecb.report202602_financialstabilityrisks.en.pdf">Financial stability risks from linkages between banks and the non-bank financial intermediation sector</a>&rdquo;. The report finds linkages between banks and the non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) sector to be significant, and while they do not currently pose acute risks to financial stability, they create important vulnerabilities that could amplify stress in adverse market conditions. Furthermore, these vulnerabilities are highly concentrated in a small number of large euro area global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). Risk-bearing capacity among euro area G-SIBs is key to absorbing shocks in the financial system and preventing the amplification of financial stress.</p>
<p>The report identifies three important and interlinked roles played by banks in interactions with the NBFI sector: liquidity management, provision of leverage and market-making. It analyses how interactions between banks and NBFIs may affect financial stability in the EU.</p>
<p>These three roles may lead to the materialisation of systemic risks through two main channels.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, a loss of funding from NBFI entities could create challenges for banks in periods of market tension owing to the short-term nature of such funding, the homogeneity of NBFI funding providers and the limited scope for substitution. A negative and systemic price shock in asset markets could trigger redemption requests to NBFIs and margin calls on derivatives and repo trades. This, in turn, could potentially result in a broad-based decline in NBFI funding to banks.</li>
<li>Second, lending to NBFI entities which use leverage indirectly exposes banks to the outcomes of NBFI trading strategies. Hedge funds and securities firms borrow from banks via repo transactions and use leverage for short-term trading. These linkages may increase vulnerability to asset price shocks, potentially leading to unwinding of positions and asset fire sales. Such dynamics could amplify market movements and generate losses for both banks and NBFI entities. Lending to leveraged NBFI entities which invest in illiquid long-term assets could be vulnerable to shocks affecting those assets, potentially leading to credit losses for banks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The report provides novel insights based on granular transaction and exposure-level data. Such data are key to understanding bank-NBFI linkages, but the analysis is constrained by data gaps and fragmented data access. Notably, data on exposures outside the EU and transactions taking place outside the EU are largely missing, reducing the visibility of risks to the EU financial sector. Improved information sharing, including a centralised mechanism for data access and sharing, could remedy some of these constraints.</p>

<title>The EBA Advises National Authorities On Actions To Take At The End Of The Transition Period Under Its No-Action Letter On The Interplay Between PSD2 And MiCA</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) published today an Opinion advising national competent authorities (NCAs) under the Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) on how to proceed once the transition period that is set in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-no-action-letter-interplay-between-payment-services-directive-psd23-and-markets-crypto"><span>EBA&rsquo;s No-Action Letter of 2 June 2025 (</span></a><span>EBA/Op/2025/08) comes to an end on 2 March 2026. The transition period allows crypto asset service providers (CASPs) nine months to continue transacting electronic money tokens that qualify as payment services while submitting, and awaiting the response to, their application for authorisation under PSD2.</span></p>
<p>The Opinion outlines the conditions under which NCAs are advised to allow CASPs to continue providing electronic money token (EMT)s that qualify as a payment service after 2 March 2026, while they do not (yet) hold a license under the PSD2. NCAs are further advised to require CASPs that do not meet all of these conditions to discontinue the provision of such EMT services. Where necessary, NCAs are advised to cooperate with the relevant national authority under the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) and/or other national enforcement authorities to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>The Opinion follows the EBA&rsquo;s No-Action Letter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-publishes-no-action-letter-interplay-between-payment-services-directive-psd23-and-markets-crypto">published on 2 June 2025</a>, which responded to a request from the European Commission to clarify the interplay between PSD2 and MiCA in relation to CASPs transacting EMTs that qualify as a payment services. The No-Action letter allowed CASPs to continue providing these services by requiring a second authorisation under PSD2 not immediately but only after a 9-month transition period. In addition, the letter advised national competent authorities to consider only a subset of crypto-asset services with EMTs as payment services, thereby reducing the number of CASPs requiring such an authorisation. It also advised national competent authorities to apply a streamlined authorisation process that makes full use of information already provided during the CASP authorisation process under MiCA, reducing the administrative burden for CASPs.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the No-Action Letter, more than 100 CASPs have approached national competent authorities informally or submitted an application for authorisation as payment service providers (PSPs). With the end of the transition period approaching, and given that application volumes are likely to vary across Member States, the EBA is issuing this Opinion to advise NCAs how to prioritise their authorisation efforts when the transition period ends.</p>
<h4><span>Legal basis</span></h4>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s competence to issue this Opinion is based on Article 29(1)(a) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010<a class="ck-anchor" href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-advises-national-authorities-actions-take-end-transition-period-under-its-no-action-letter#_ftn1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>, which requires the EBA to play an active role in building a common Union supervisory culture and consistent supervisory practices, as well as in ensuring uniform procedures and consistent approaches throughout the Union, including by issuing Opinions addressed to national competent authorities.</p>

<p>ACER welcomes ENTSOG&rsquo;s stress-testing of the gas system, the inclusion of the Russian gas phase-out and the consideration of the remaining gas dependency in the electricity sector.</p>
<p>However, it notes that the future security of supply assessments require moving beyond infrastructure constraints to better reflect supply challenges and diversification.</p>

<title>Testimony Before The U.S. Senate Committee On Banking, Housing, And Urban Affairs, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Washington D.C., Feb. 12, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Chairman Scott, Ranking Member Warren, and Members of the Committee: It is an honor to testify before you today. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-testimony-sbhuac-021126?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Nine months ago, I returned to the SEC with a clear mandate to recommit the agency to our core mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. I am grateful to work alongside dedicated public servants who have hit the ground running in pursuit of these priorities.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s $124.3 trillion capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, leading both in market capitalization and trading volume. They are a marvel of human ingenuity. Yet over the years, the federal government&rsquo;s natural tendency has asserted itself, and rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve.</p>
<p>This Congress and the Trump Administration are focused on bringing down the cost of living for the American people, and the SEC has a vital role to play. For example, public companies spend $2.7 billion a year to file their annual reports. This is $2.7 billion that companies are not reinvesting in their businesses to create jobs. $2.7 billion that our disclosure regime is diverting from your constituents to corporate lawyers, accountants, and consultants.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say that we want to gut corporate disclosure, which is vital. But we must modernize, rationalize, and streamline reports so that they are meaningful, understandable, and not a repellant to investors. After all, how many of you would read through an annual filing that rivals&nbsp;<em>War and Peace</em>? Disclosure documents of that length can do more to obscure than to illuminate.</p>
<p>As I have stated previously, regulation ideally should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority. Instead, it has made the path to public ownership narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit.</p>
<p>For context, shortly after I left the SEC in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,800 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges. By the time that I returned as Chairman, that figure had fallen by roughly 40 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-testimony-sbhuac-021126?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>This trajectory tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep that the SEC is working to rectify through the three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again: first, re-anchoring disclosures in materiality so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than on regulatory noise; second, de-politicizing shareholder meetings by restoring their focus to significant corporate matters; and third, allowing public companies to have litigation alternatives so that we shield innovators from the frivolous and investors from the fraudulent. I also applaud the bipartisan initiatives that you are considering in Congress, including those in the Senate&rsquo;s Empowering Main Street in America Act and the House&rsquo;s INVEST Act, to help keep America&rsquo;s capital markets open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them.</p>
<p>Of course, I also support congressional efforts to enact the CLARITY Act. Upon its passage, the Commission stands ready to implement this landmark legislation. A federal framework for crypto markets is long overdue. Under Commissioner Hester Peirce&rsquo;s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation.</p>
<p>As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation. Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations. We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain.</p>
<p>Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security. As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually. Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025&mdash;which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs&mdash;by approximately $92 million over the course of the year.</p>
<p>The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually. In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly.</p>
<p>Those cost reductions reflect the SEC&rsquo;s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem. In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million&mdash;a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman&rsquo;s and other Board members&rsquo; compensation, respectively.</p>
<p>As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service. When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget. The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service. The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work. I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB&mdash;one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors.</p>
<p>Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them. Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day. And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm.</p>
<p>Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers. In the fall, meanwhile, we announced the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Cross-Border Task Force to strengthen and enhance our efforts to identify and combat cross-border fraud. Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities. I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S. investor protections. Markets are global. Investor protection must be as well.</p>
<p>As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago. So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today&rsquo;s hearing. I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead. Thank you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=aD7NMsGxt8sMlcvv5SEJ_WgoBXkcKakVVWLadfWi39vxIoYXFctJCfMTz8KNk8TG5cFOd0XQmUeLw-Xffphy_g==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fiserv, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NASDAQ: FISV), a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology, today announced the launch of INDX, a real-time cash settlement platform that helps digital asset companies securely store and transfer US dollars in real-time 24x7x365. With INDX, digital asset companies can leverage a single custodial account that benefits from up to $25 million of FDIC insurance, delivering a safer and more durable solution to store and transfer real USD.</p>
<p>Rather than routing funds outside of traditional banking systems or pushing funds on-chain, INDX is redefining fiat operations for digital asset companies by distributing their funds across the Fiserv Deposit Network, an ecosystem of more than 1,100 insured US-based financial institutions. This keeps cash securely off-chain while delivering the real-time settlement speed and flexible operating windows demanded by digital asset companies.</p>
<p>For community banks and credit unions within the Fiserv Deposit Network, diversified deposit sources like those managed by INDX, create a new pipeline of cost-efficient, stable, and granular deposits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;INDX advances the strategic vision behind bringing StoneCastle into the Fiserv ecosystem, combining our unique position at the intersection of banking and commerce with proven insured-deposit funding solutions to create differentiated value for our clients,&rdquo; said Takis Georgakopoulos, Co-President at Fiserv. &ldquo;For the first time, digital asset companies have a settlement engine to move real fiat US dollars in a manner that is faster, more secure, scalable, and fully programmable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Designed for the needs of institutional traders, INDX provides digital asset companies with the ability to:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><span>Institutional Grade Accounts</span>: Open a secure and accessible custodial account, from our affiliated US-based trust company.</li>
<li><span>Faster Transfers</span>: Transact with counterparties in milliseconds, 24x7x365 where every transfer is final and instantly available in USD.&nbsp;</li>
<li><span>Structurally Safer</span>: Through Fiserv&rsquo;s deposit network, balances are eligible for up to $25 million of FDIC insurance, which is 100x more than a traditional account.</li>
<li><span>Fully Programmable</span>: Take advantage of programmability through real-time API access to include institutional grade controls and integrations.<br /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>Fiserv&rsquo;s strategic acquisition of StoneCastle in December 2025 continues to elevate offerings for innovative deposit funding solutions.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solactive is pleased to announce its first collaboration with Averdas AG on the launch of the Solactive Averdas Productivity Leaders US 1500 Index and its US 500 version. Developed through a data-driven and rules-based framework, this innovative index identifies U.S. companies that demonstrate superior productivity, operational resilience, and sustainable profitability, even during adverse economic conditions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In the context of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, productivity has emerged as a key performance driver. Firms that effectively combine profitability with operational efficiency are increasingly distinguished by their ability to withstand economic pressures and sustain long-term value creation. Averdas&rsquo; proprietary methodology targets such firms, offering a differentiated lens on productivity through asset deployment, process efficiency, and financial resilience.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0S0D7">Solactive Averdas Productivity Leaders US 1500</a>&nbsp;Index applies a structured three-step selection process to constituents of the Solactive GBS United States 1500 Index. First, it identifies the top 40 companies with the highest Asset Productivity scores, which evaluate the efficient use of capital, labor, and technology. Among these, five are selected for their Process Productivity, focusing on sustainable profitability derived from structural efficiency. The remaining 25 constituents are selected based on Resilience, assessing companies&rsquo; ability to maintain productivity amid market volatility. All selected components are equally weighted, and the index undergoes rebalancing on an annual basis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.solactive.com/indices/?index=DE000SL0S131">Solactive Averdas Productivity Leaders US 500</a>&nbsp;Index applies the same structured selection and weighting process, but processes the constituents of the Solactive GBS United States 500 Index as index universe.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Timo Pfeiffer, Chief Markets Officer at Solactive, commented</span>:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;</em><em>We are thrilled to announce our first collaboration with Averdas on the launch of this pioneering productivity-focused index. This project showcases the power of combining exceptional research with in-depth indexing expertise to develop highly differentiated investment strategies.&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prof. Dr. Leo Brecht, Chairman and Co-Founder at Averdas, commented:&nbsp;</span><em>&ldquo;We are proud to collaborate with Solactive in launching the Solactive Averdas Productivity Leaders US 1500 Index and the Solactive Averdas Productivity Leaders US 500 Index. Productivity is one of the most consistent drivers of long-term value creation, and this index translates our research-driven approach into a transparent, rules-based strategy that helps investors access companies combining efficiency, resilience, and sustainable profitability.&rdquo;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG&nbsp;today announces&nbsp;plans to build an on-chain settlement capability, the&nbsp;LSEG Digital Securities Depository (DSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The LSEG DSD,&nbsp;a market&nbsp;infrastructure solution for institutional market participants,&nbsp;will&nbsp;be fully interoperable, connecting traditional and digital markets, supporting multiple chains, and seamless interaction between existing settlement platforms and emerging digital infrastructures.&nbsp;The first deliverable&nbsp;is planned for&nbsp;2026,&nbsp;subject to regulatory approval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG already&nbsp;operates&nbsp;a DLT-based&nbsp;Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI),&nbsp;powered by Microsoft Azure,&nbsp;which has enabled tokenisation and broader distribution of funds.&nbsp;Read more here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lseg.com/en/media-centre/press-releases/2025/lseg-launches-digital-markets-infrastructure-platform-for-private-funds-and-facilitates-first-transaction">LSEG launches Digital Markets Infrastructure platform for private funds, and facilitates first transaction | LSEG</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;new&nbsp;DSD&nbsp;capability will&nbsp;drive&nbsp;greater collateral&nbsp;management efficiencies and&nbsp;facilitate&nbsp;access to liquidity for a broad range of assets, including fixed income, equities, and private markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>LSEG is&nbsp;building&nbsp;to a future where&nbsp;most&nbsp;bonds issued and available on exchanges&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;and eventually most securities&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;are tokenised, enabling market participants to&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from greater transparency and improved efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of the design and go-to-market process,&nbsp;LSEG&nbsp;will form a strategic partner group to&nbsp;ensure market feedback is&nbsp;incorporated into the build,&nbsp;and&nbsp;to unlock scale and enable issuance,&nbsp;settlement&nbsp;and trading in both digitally native and digital representation of traditional securities.&nbsp;Participants of this programme will be announced in due course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Daniel Maguire, Group Head of Markets, LSEG:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;We look forward to welcoming&nbsp;new strategic partners as we build LSEG Digital Market Infrastructure - a seamless ecosystem in which participants can move effortlessly between digital and traditional markets, connected across time zones and choice of payment options.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ryan Hayward, Head of Digital Assets, Barclays:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Securities Depository is a positive step in the development and adoption of digital assets across UK markets. Barclays will continue to work with the UK government, LSEG and other providers on exploring a range of digital assets, as well as developing our own use cases.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sir Ron Kalifa, Head of Financial Infrastructure, Brookfield:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Brookfield is excited to continue expanding our partnership with LSEG around helping to shape the future of financial infrastructure innovation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rob Hale, Co-Head of Global Markets,&nbsp;Lloyds:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Lloyds welcomes LSEG&rsquo;s commitment to building next generation digital market infrastructure. Through our work with tokenised deposits, tokenised&nbsp;gilts&nbsp;and digital wallets,&nbsp;we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;seen how these innovations can deliver real benefits for businesses and investors. These capabilities can help clients compress settlement cycles, reduce operational&nbsp;risk&nbsp;and access liquidity more efficiently &ndash;&nbsp;ultimately improving&nbsp;how they raise,&nbsp;deploy&nbsp;and manage capital. We look forward to working with LSEG to help clients&nbsp;operate&nbsp;more efficiently and unlock new opportunities through digitally enabled financial services.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Matt Harvey, Head of Digital Solutions, NatWest Markets:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Securities Depository&nbsp;represents&nbsp;an important step&nbsp;in modernising the UK&rsquo;s financial market infrastructure. As digital securities move from pilot to scaled adoption, solutions that combine regulatory rigour with genuine interoperability will be critical. We welcome LSEG&rsquo;s focus on practical, market‑wide connectivity and see this as a positive development for the UK&rsquo;s digital capital markets ecosystem.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Salman Ansari, Global Head, Capital Markets, Standard Chartered:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The development of institutional-grade digital market infrastructure is a critical step in bridging traditional and digital capital markets. We welcome this initiative from LSEG that prioritises aspects around interoperability, operational&nbsp;resilience&nbsp;and integration with existing market plumbing. These elements are key to institutional adoption, which is needed to unlock scale for the next phase of digital fixed income market evolution.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Angus Fletcher, Global Head of Digital Solutions, State Street:</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;As tokenisation continues to mature, interoperability between traditional and digital market infrastructure will be critical. We are pleased to engage with LSEG as it develops the Digital Securities Depository, and we look forward to collaborating to assess models that support institutional adoption while meeting the operational and regulatory expectations of our clients.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<title>Z/Yen Group: The Role Of Finance In Addressing Sustainable Development</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/zyen-group-the-role-of-finance-in-addressing-sustainable-development-2026212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/zyen-group-the-role-of-finance-in-addressing-sustainable-development-2026212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Z/Yen Group today released its report &ldquo;The Role of Finance in Addressing Sustainable Development&rdquo; as commissioned by the Financial Services Development Council (FSDC).</p>
<p>The global financial system is evolving from a passive allocator of capital to an active force shaping growth pathways that foster resilience and inclusion. Global financing for sustainable development rose by 22% to USD 5.2 trillion between 2015 and 2024. Despite this progress, a persistent funding gap remains in critical sectors such as clean energy, infrastructure, and social resilience, with developing countries alone requiring an additional USD 4 trillion annually to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and other climate targets.</p>
<p>The publication provides an overview of how instruments such as green bonds, sustainability-linked loans, impact investment funds, blended finance and others are redefining traditional notions of risk, value, and accountability. Advances in disclosure standards and digital measurement tools are further strengthening the credibility and transparency of sustainable finance worldwide.</p>
<p>A central theme of the report is the pivotal role of international financial centres as both governance anchors and innovation platforms for sustainable finance. The publication profiles Hong Kong as a case study, demonstrating how the city has systematically embedded sustainability into its financial architecture, regulatory frameworks, and market practice, while sustaining its competitiveness and credibility as a leading international hub.</p>
<p>Mr Mike Wardle, CEO of the Z/Yen Group, highlighted: &ldquo;Hong Kong&rsquo;s ascent as a green and sustainable hub has been propelled by its strategic vision, decisive policy direction, and relentless commitment to international best practices. This is also supported by Hong Kong&rsquo;s active role in advancing green technology development. This dynamic ecosystem attracts top technology innovators as well as investors eager to finance projects with tangible impact and high visibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Benjamin Hung, Chairman of the FSDC, remarked, &ldquo;As an international financial centre, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to mobilise both public and private capital to support the transition to a low-carbon, more inclusive economy. Our close connectivity with the Chinese Mainland, the vast opportunities arising from the Greater Bay Area and Belt and Road Initiative, along with our robust strengths in sustainable finance, further reinforce Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a leading platform for globally aligned, high-quality sustainable investments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The insights and practices shared in this publication provide a valuable blueprint for financial centres committed to advancing sustainable progress with notable impact.</p>
<p>The full version of the report can be downloaded <a href="https://www.zyen.com/publications/professional-articles/the-role-of-finance-in-addressing-sustainable-development/" title="here">here</a>.</p>

<p><span><i>&ldquo;As we continue to enhance efficiency and focus on value creation for our investors, Broadridge&rsquo;s Trade Assignment Portal provides us with a simple and effective way to streamline AOT processes,&rdquo;</i></span><span>&nbsp;<b>said Shuichi&nbsp;Uchida, General&nbsp;Manager &amp; Head&nbsp;of&nbsp;Trading&nbsp;Department at Nissay Asset Management Corporation.</b>&nbsp;</span><span><i>&ldquo;This automation frees up time from administrative tasks, allowing us to focus more on trading and analysis.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>Trade Assignment Portal automates and digitizes Nissay Asset Management&rsquo;s Assignment of Trade (AOT) processes for TBA (To-Be-Announced) trading of mortgage‑backed securities, allowing the firm to instantly create and electronically sign contract documents, send AOT letters to multiple recipients at once, and track progress in real time. The solution also stores completed AOTs securely in the cloud, significantly reducing manual workload and improving transparency.</span></p>
<p><span><i>&ldquo;We are proud to support Nissay Asset Management in modernizing their AOT operations,&rdquo;</i></span><span>&nbsp;<b>said David&nbsp;Runacres, President&nbsp;of&nbsp;APAC at Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;</span><span><i>&ldquo;Trade Assignment Portal exemplifies how Broadridge helps firms across Asia achieve greater automation, transparency, and efficiency. By transforming the traditionally manual, email‑based Assignment of Trade process into a connected digital workflow, Trade Assignment Portal not only streamlines operations but also builds the foundation for future network value and collaboration across market participants.&rdquo;</i></span></p>
<p><span>Nissay Asset Management chose Broadridge&rsquo;s solution because Trade Assignment Portal streamlines existing email‑based AOT workflows while preserving core processes&mdash;allowing the firm to build on its operational expertise and established broker relationships. The implementation comes as Japan&rsquo;s asset management industry faces growing pressure to reduce routine tasks and allocate more resources toward initiatives that deliver greater value to investors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By reducing AOT processing time, Trade Assignment Portal enables Nissay Asset Management&rsquo;s traders to focus more on planning and execution, strengthening operational agility and client outcomes.</span></p>

<div>The&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://autorek.com/report/autorek-payments-operations-report-2026/?utm_source=PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_campaign=paymentsindustryreportpr" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2026 Payments Survey</a>, based on 250 interviews with&nbsp;senior finance sector managers&nbsp;across the UK and U.S, highlights what AutoRek calls "The Great Payments Paradox": while 96% of firms are adopting AI and 67% say instant payment networks are accelerating the need for real-time controls, 69% cite manual processes and limited automation as their biggest scalability constraint. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><i>&nbsp;</i></b></div>
<div><i>&ldquo;The findings of The Future of Payments Operations 2026 report highlight both the strength of the UK payments sector and the scale of the opportunity that lies ahead. UK firms continue to demonstrate ambition in adopting real-time payments, AI, and emerging settlement rails, reinforcing the UK's position as a leading global payments hub.&rdquo;&nbsp;</i><b><i>said Benjamin David, Head of Intelligence at The Payments Association</i></b><i>&nbsp;&ldquo;However, the research also underlines the importance of ensuring that operational capabilities, data infrastructure, and governance frameworks evolve in step with front-end innovation. For payments leaders, this presents a clear strategic priority: sustained competitiveness will depend not just on product and market expansion, but on building resilient, scalable operational foundations that support growth over the long term.&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Fragmented data and manual processes block AI&rsquo;s&nbsp;value</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The survey reveals that two-thirds (34%) of firms report significant disruption to reconciliation and&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;due to fragmented data. Despite industry-wide modernization efforts, over half (54%) of businesses&nbsp;remain&nbsp;only partially implemented on ISO 20022,&nbsp;adding increased complexity when richer data should reduce it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>These data and back-office issues directly constrain firms' ability to scale AI investments.&nbsp;While AI adoption has increased, confidence in scaling&nbsp;remains&nbsp;an issue. Top concerns include data security and regulatory compliance (61%), implementation costs (50%)&nbsp;and legacy system integration (46%).&nbsp;Firms will struggle to extract value from broken foundations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>"AI doesn't fix broken data. It amplifies whatever foundation it's built on,"&nbsp;</i><b><i>said Jim Sadler, Chief Product, Technology and Operations Officer at AutoRek.</i></b><i>&nbsp;"Without clean, reconciled data, front-end AI investments cannot deliver reliable outcomes."&nbsp;</i></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Operational gaps create regulatory and competitive risk</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This operational unpreparedness also has a direct impact on&nbsp;regulatory readiness. With&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps25-12-changes-safeguarding-regime-payments-and-e-money-firms" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">safeguarding deadlines</a>&nbsp;approaching, only 33% of firms say they are fully prepared for upcoming compliance requirements, while 84% expect their controls to require updates within 12 months. Firms are struggling to build the real-time controls regulators demand on fragmented foundations.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As firms expect 24% of payment volume to flow through blockchain-based rails by 2030, the gap between operationally mature&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;and those struggling to keep pace will likely widen. Without automated back-office operations and unified data foundations, firms will struggle to meet evolving regulatory requirements or compete effectively in an increasingly real-time payments landscape.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><i>&ldquo;Forward-thinking firms will treat regulatory readiness as a competitive differentiator, rather than just a compliance exercise,"&nbsp;</i><b><i>said Nick Botha, VP of Payments and Retail Banking at AutoRek.</i></b><i>&nbsp;"The payments industry is not short on ambition and innovation; it is short on operational alignment. 2026 will determine whether firms can close the gap between real-time strategy and manual reality - separating market leaders from those left behind.&rdquo;</i></div>

<title>UK Government Update On The Procurement For Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) Pilot</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The government has appointed HSBC as the platform provider for the Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) pilot issuance following a competitive procurement process.</span></p>
<p>oday&rsquo;s announcement is an exciting step towards launching the DIGIT issuance, a key pillar of the government&rsquo;s Wholesale Financial Markets Digital Strategy.</p>
<p>At Mansion House last year, the government committed to delivering a range of design features, which included ensuring that DIGIT is accessible to a wide range of participants and supporting the development of secondary markets. The government is actively engaging with additional suppliers to support the delivery of these features, together with HSBC.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lucy Rigby KC MP, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We want to attract investment and make the UK the best place to do business, which is why we are launching DIGIT to understand how the UK can capitalise on this technology, deliver efficiencies and reduce costs for firms.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">This is exactly the kind of financial innovation we need to keep the UK at the forefront of global capital markets and I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with HSBC and other parties to deliver DIGIT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government published its invitation to tender (ITT) for the Digital Gilt Instrument (DIGIT) in October 2025 and would like to thank all the prospective suppliers that submitted bids. This was a competitive tender process where HSBC&rsquo;s proposal was chosen against the government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.find-tender.service.gov.uk/Notice/073385-2025" rel="external">published assessment criteria.</a></p>
<p><strong>Patrick George, Global Head of Markets &amp; Securities Services, HSBC, said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">HSBC is delighted to be supporting the continued development of the gilt market, market innovation, and the growth of the broader UK economy.&nbsp; We are very pleased that HM Treasury has chosen our market-leading digital assets platform, HSBC Orion, for the DIGIT pilot issuance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The government has also appointed Ashurst LLP to provide legal services for the DIGIT pilot. Ashurst&rsquo;s digital assets team is supporting the government in its preparations to launch DIGIT.</p>
<p><strong>Etay Katz, Head of Digital Assets, Ashurst said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We are proud to have been appointed by HM Treasury to advise on this landmark transaction. Our team brings deep expertise in digital assets transactions, and we look forward to working with HSBC and supporting the government as it takes this transformative step for UK capital markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>The DIGIT Pilot</strong></p>
<p>DIGIT will support the Government&rsquo;s commitment to maintain the UK as a world-leading and global financial centre. As other financial hubs explore DLT, the potential for significant growth in this area is clear. By launching now, the Government is positioning the UK financial services sector to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>
<p>The pilot is seeking to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable the Government to explore how DLT can be applied to UK sovereign debt issuance processes.</li>
<li>Catalyse the development of UK based DLT infrastructure and the adoption of DLT across UK financial markets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The pilot&rsquo;s design features include DIGIT being digitally native, short-dated, issued on a platform operating within the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS), delivering on-chain settlement and independent of the Government&rsquo;s main debt management programme.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CME Group, the world's leading derivatives marketplace, today announced plans to launch four&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">South Asia</span>&nbsp;edible oil futures contracts on&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">March 2, 2026</span>, pending regulatory review.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new products are cash-settled and include two outright contracts and two spread contracts that will be based on the Fastmarkets Soyoil CFR India and Crude Palm Oil CFR West Coast India assessments:</p>
<ul>
<li>South Asia Soybean Oil (Fastmarkets) Futures</li>
<li>South Asia Crude Palm Oil (Fastmarket) Futures</li>
<li>South Asia Soybean Oil (Fastmarkets) vs. CBOT Soybean Oil Futures</li>
<li>South Asia Crude Palm Oil (Fastmarkets) vs. USD Malaysian Crude Palm Oil Futures</li>

"By using Fastmarkets indices, these new futures contracts will serve as additional tools for South Asian market participants to insure against soybean and palm oil price risk or trade the spread between oils as a proxy to hedge basis exposure."</p>
<p>"<span class="xn-location">South Asia</span>&nbsp;is a crucial hub in the global supply chain, accounting for an estimated 45% of&nbsp;soyoil and 30% of palm oil trade," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Przemek Koralewski</span>, Global Head of Market Development at Fastmarkets. "Our prices bring much-needed transparency to this critical market. Partnering with CME Group will enable traders to discover prices and manage risk more effectively."</p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia Names Malaysia’s First Social Exchange Platform Operator</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) today announced the appointment of LC Wakaful Digital Sdn Bhd (LCWD) as the first Social Exchange Platform operator in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The Social Exchange is a key initiative under the new Capital Market Masterplan 2026-2030 (CMP) designed to broaden access and market participation to social impact financing.</p>
<p>The Social Exchange Platform will provide a structured and transparent avenue for non-profit organisations to raise donations for eligible social projects while enabling donors to have greater visibility over fund utilisation and the impact of the projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This initiative aligns with the whole-of-nation approach of CMP 2026-2030, emphasising collaboration to sustain national economic resilience.</p>
<p>SC Chairman Dato&rsquo; Mohammad Faiz Azmi said the appointment of the Social Exchange Platform operator marked a key step towards establishing a market based, transparent and wellgoverned platform for non-profit organisations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the Social Exchange, we are institutionalising trust in social finance,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are providing a structured avenue for non-profit organisations to scale their impact while giving donors the transparency and confidence they need to participate in Malaysia&rsquo;s sustainable development journey.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The appointment of the operator marks an important milestone in operationalising the Social Exchange. This follows the Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement in May 2024 on the introduction of the Social Exchange initiative and the successful implementation of the Social Exchange Pilot Programme by the SC in the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>The Guidelines on Social Exchange Platforms (Guidelines) which set out the regulatory requirements<sup>1</sup> for operators and non-profit organisations, were released subsequently on 19 September 2025.&nbsp; Applications for registration as a Social Exchange Platform operator commenced on the same date.</p>
<p>As the operator, LCWD is registered under section 76A of the Capital Markets and Services Act 2007 (CMSA). It will be responsible for establishing and operating Malaysia&rsquo;s first Social Exchange Platform, Impakrintas, as well as onboarding eligible non-profit organisations in accordance with the requirements set out in the Guidelines.</p>
<p>With the appointment of LCWD as the Social Exchange Platform operator for the first year of Phase 1, the SC will closely assess market participation, the orderly development and viability of the platform, and the overall market readiness before considering expansion for other operators. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This initial phase, which aims to Go-Live on 19 February 2026 will see the platform facilitate direct cash donations from donors to approved non-profit organisations under subsection 44(6) of the Income Tax Act 1967. In the subsequent phases, the scope of the Social Exchange will be further expanded for wider participation and broadened to include capital market instruments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon Impakrintas&rsquo; Go-Live, as a start, six non-profit organisations are expected to be onboarded onto the platform with listings of wide-ranging social impact projects, including equitable access to healthcare, early intervention programmes for youth on sexual and reproductive health education, food security, inclusive livelihoods and environmental sustainability. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Donations made through the Social Exchange will be eligible for equivalent tax treatment under subsection 44(6) and paragraph 13(1) of Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 1967, benefiting both non-profit organisations raising funds and donors supporting social impact projects listed on Impakrintas. &nbsp;</p>

<title>Additional Budget Estimates, Opening Statement By ASIC Acting Chair Sarah Court, Senate Economics Legislation Committee, 11 February 2026</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/additional-budget-estimates-opening-statement-by-asic-acting-chair-sarah-court-2026212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good evening</p>
<p>I am attending today as Acting Chair as Joe Longo is currently on leave. I am joined tonight by Commissioners Alan Kirkland, Kate O&rsquo;Rourke and Simone Constant, CEO Scott Gregson and Executive Director for Enforcement and Compliance, Chris Savundra.</p>
<p>As we are likely to be short on time there are three brief matters I want to update the Committee on:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, ASIC has continued its extensive work in relation to the failures of the Shield and First Guardian Master Funds. In addition to recovering funds of more than $420m for investors, since our last appearance in October last year we have taken a number of further Court actions including against: SQM, the research house responsible for the ratings of the Shield fund; financial advice firms Interprac Financial Planning and MWL, lead generator Imperial Capital Group; and Diversa Trustees Limited, alleging failures concerning the First Guardian Master Fund. Around $300 million was invested into First Guardian through superannuation funds for which Diversa was trustee.</p>
<p>We have also commenced a widespread communications campaign with consumers that may be impacted. We have begun sending further information to the Australians who invested in First Guardian and Shield, including a link to a dedicated consumer website that contains trusted and independent information and support.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, in December ASIC obtained multiple commitments from the ASX Group on an important package of reforms including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strengthening the independence and governance of ASX&rsquo;s Clearing and Settlement Facilities Boards</li>
<li>A strategic reset of ASX&rsquo;s transformation program &lsquo;Accelerate&rsquo;, with clear milestones and accountability for delivery</li>
<li>The imposition of an additional capital charge to ensure ASX maintains robust financial resources until remediation is complete.</li>
<li>We note the ASX&rsquo;s announcement about its CEO yesterday and would reiterate the ASIC Chair&rsquo;s comments that it is critical ASX&rsquo;s board has confidence in its senior leadership given the significant work ahead for that organisation to meet the expectations of the market and the public.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Third</strong>, I know some members of this Committee have a keen interest in ensuring that those who break our financial services laws are properly held to account, and in recent time we have seen some significant sentences imposed. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>On 30 October 2025 Chris MARCO was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 12 years, following his conviction on multiple counts of fraud relating to more than $34m misappropriated from investors. The sentence was the highest imposed by an Australian court following an ASIC investigation. We note that Mr Marco is currently appealing his conviction.</li>
<li>On 7 November 2025, Krishnakumar AGRAWAL was sentenced to four years and ten months imprisonment, with a non-parole period of more than three years, for dishonest use of his position as a director. This matter related to a property group that collapsed owing investors from Sydney&rsquo;s Indian community over $20m.</li>
<li>On 22 January 2026, Anthony TORRE was sentenced to six years imprisonment, with four years non-parole, for stealing and fraud related to his clients&rsquo; superannuation funds over a five-year period.</li>
<li>On 23 January 2026, Rodney FORREST was sentenced to six years imprisonment, with three years non-parole, for insider trading offences relating to shares in Platinum Asset Management.</li>
</ul>
<p>This result reverses a trend of lower custodial sentences for insider trading offences, and the Forrest matter marks the first outcome for ASIC&rsquo;s new specialist insider trading team which investigated and finalised the case within 16 months of the offending.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to taking your questions.</p>

<title>ASX Limited Half-Year Results To 31 December 2025 (1H26)</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-limited-half-year-results-to-31-december-2025-1h26-2026212/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asx-limited-half-year-results-to-31-december-2025-1h26-2026212/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse made the following comments:</p>
<h4>Highlights from our 1H26 result</h4>
<p>&ldquo;ASX achieved strong revenue growth of 11.2% to $602.8 million in the half and we continued to deliver key business outcomes during the period. Revenue performance was driven by high volumes for cash market trading, clearing and settlement, and interest rate futures. It was particularly pleasing to see all four business units contributing to our result, underscoring the value of ASX&rsquo;s diversified business model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Underlying net profit after tax was up 3.9% to $263.6 million, which reflects the impact from increased operating expenses. Total operating expenses were up 20.0%. When we exclude expenses associated with the ASIC Inquiry, our core business expense growth was up 12.1%.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Partnering with our customers continues to be a key focus for our teams, and key highlights during the period include the launch of gold ETF options and new environmental futures products. This is the first time we are extending our ETF options offering into the commodities asset class, and the addition of morning and peak&nbsp;electricity contracts will support customers as they manage risk and adapt to the increased supply of renewable energy to the grid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our technology modernisation program is progressing, and we are leveraging leading global capability through our technology partnerships to deliver future-ready market infrastructure for Australia. We are making final preparations ahead of switching over to the new clearing platform with CHESS Release 1, which will use the new enterprise cloud and data platforms. We are working closely with our market participants on readiness measures as we get closer to our target go-live date of April 2026.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the major work to deliver CHESS Release 1 now largely complete, we will be farewelling our Group Executive Securities &amp; Payments Clive Triance at the end of this month. Last October Clive stated his intention to retire. We have appointed Andrew Jones as interim Group Executive who will continue to deliver for our customers and the market as we work through the process for a permanent replacement.&rdquo;`</p>

<title>Remarks To The Los Angeles County Bar Association, Margaret Ryan, Director, SEC Division Of Enforcement, 56th Annual Securities Regulation Seminar, Los Angeles, Feb. 11, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you for that kind introduction, Michele (Layne).&nbsp;And thank you to the organizers of this important conference for the invitation to speak to you today.&nbsp;Having now spent several months as its Director, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the direction in which the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement is headed &ndash; a topic I know is of particular interest to this group.</p>
<p>Before I begin, however, please note that my remarks today are made in my official capacity as the Director of the Division of Enforcement and may not reflect the views of the Commission, the Commissioners, or other members of the staff.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Before I dive into the Division&rsquo;s current priorities, I&rsquo;d like to take a step back. My legal career has been profoundly defined by public service: in the Marine Corps, as a law clerk, and on the bench.&nbsp;I see my current role as a continuation of this commitment to public service.</p>
<p>As I told the Division staff in my first week on the job, I did not seek the role of Director of the SEC&rsquo;s Enforcement Division.&nbsp;Rather, this role found me.&nbsp;And for that, I am grateful to have the opportunity to assist Chairman Atkins in righting the ship from some of the excesses of the prior administration.</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m grateful for the opportunity to make my first public remarks here today, because I want to share with you my guiding principles as Director, how those principles relate to the Division&rsquo;s process and priorities &ndash; which we are continuously evaluating and always looking to improve &ndash; and why I believe these principles complement those of Chairman Atkins.</p>
<p>So, principles, process, priorities.</p>
<h2>Guiding Principles</h2>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been leading the Division long, but I&rsquo;ve been here long enough to see and admire the deep technical expertise held by both the Commission staff and the securities bar, developed and nurtured over the last ninety-plus years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that context, however, I offer that my guiding principles as the Director are no different than those which have guided me as a Marine, as a law clerk, and as a judge.</p>
<p>Namely, integrity, honor, fidelity to the law, and an unwavering commitment to the fair and judicious use of the formidable power and resources the federal government has entrusted to me.&nbsp;To quote Spiderman, with great power comes great responsibility.</p>
<p>I believe these principles mirror the Chairman&rsquo;s commitment to upholding the rule of law and ensuring fair process to all those who participate in and benefit from our capital markets.&nbsp;And, under his leadership, it is a true privilege to lead my extraordinarily talented staff as they animate these principles every day.</p>
<p>Now, I am acutely aware of the criticisms of how the Division operated in the past, some of which I think are valid and warranted course correction.&nbsp;But I will not let the Division be weighed down by criticism that is misinformed, has been remedied, or only exists as historical artifact.&nbsp;Our mission &ndash; of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation &ndash; is too important.</p>
<p>So today, I will discuss two primary topics: process and priorities.</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>I want to start with an aspect of our work that is important to me as well as to Chairman Atkins: the process the Division provides to those involved in enforcement investigations.&nbsp;The Division of Enforcement is committed to providing transparent and appropriate process to individuals and to companies under investigation by Enforcement.</p>
<p>One of the ways we demonstrate this commitment is by adhering to the Wells process, which is a mechanism through which the enforcement staff notifies potential defendants or respondents of charges &ndash; and the basis for those charges &ndash; in advance of recommending the Commission authorize those charges.&nbsp; The proposed defendant or respondent now has a four-week window to make a submission explaining why the Commission should not authorize an enforcement action, stating their position on the merits.</p>
<p>This is a meaningful opportunity for Wells recipients to address key issues of fact or law before an enforcement recommendation is made.&nbsp;Wells recipients are also typically granted the opportunity to meet with Division leadership to &ldquo;make their case.&rdquo;&nbsp;This is a very meaningful opportunity.</p>
<p>As a judge, I recognize the virtue of an adversarial system and its propensity to reveal the right conclusion, and to get to the truth.&nbsp;As the Director I see that virtue in the Wells process.&nbsp;By facilitating an open, informed, and thoughtful dialogue between staff and parties under investigation, we not only provide transparency and a fair opportunity to respond, but we also receive the benefits of zealous advocacy regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the case.&nbsp;This ensures that, before taking the significant step of recommending an enforcement action, a recommendation which will have real effects on individuals and businesses while occupying significant enforcement resources, we &ndash; and the Commission &ndash; have considered a more fully-developed record and put ourselves in the best possible position to &ldquo;get it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A member of the enforcement senior leadership team will attend every Wells meeting, and I can assure you that all Wells submissions will be read and carefully considered.</p>
<p>And, as Chairman Atkins recently noted, the Commission also receives the submissions and is expected to read them &ndash; and I am convinced that they do.&nbsp;A compelling Wells submission can and may make a difference both at the enforcement recommendation stage and when the Commission is determining how to vote on an enforcement recommendation.</p>
<p>But this process only works if both sides engage fairly and in good faith.</p>
<p>I thus emphasize one final point with respect to process.&nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve described, I believe the Division&rsquo;s process is both transparent and fair.&nbsp;But I would advise those in the defense bar not to mistake fairness for weakness.</p>
<p>Recognize that the staff is seeking to move expeditiously, and to reach conclusions and make recommendations within reasonable time periods to uphold our obligations as public servants.&nbsp;At the same time, we are committed to professional courtesy, consideration, and &ndash; where we can &ndash; flexibility.&nbsp;Deliberate circumvention of the process, however, including tactical tardiness and other games, will not be tolerated.&nbsp;Make no mistake, counsels&rsquo; incentives, financial or otherwise, to prolong an investigation (and then complain about how long the investigation took) will be met by steadfast commitment to reasonable and timely resolution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will hold my staff, and you, to that standard.</p>
<h2>Enforcement Priorities</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve laid the foundation of process, let&rsquo;s move to my priorities for the Enforcement Division, which, again, are informed by the Chairman&rsquo;s views and our historic emphasis.</p>
<p>First and foremost.&nbsp;The Enforcement Division remains focused on its mission to vigorously enforce federal securities laws in accordance with the Chairman&rsquo;s focus on returning to the basics, with fairness and a focus on timely resolution of cases.&nbsp;The Division&rsquo;s dedication to this purpose not only protects investors, but preserves fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitates capital formation &ndash; the very mandates of the agency itself.&nbsp; In my time as head of the Division, I can attest that the staff are truly doing good work on behalf of the American people.&nbsp;The office brims with bright, mission-driven lawyers, analysts, and accountants &ndash; professionals in every sense of the word &ndash; who remain committed to our mission.&nbsp;Fraud in our capital markets persists, and so does my staff as they work to eliminate it.</p>
<p>Put another way &ndash; reports that enforcement work at the SEC has been tossed to the wayside are not only greatly exaggerated but flat out wrong.&nbsp;But I will say that I am far more concerned with the quality and impact of the enforcement actions that we bring than with chasing numbers.</p>
<p>And the reality is that I do not have unlimited resources at my disposal.&nbsp;As such, I focus on using the resources we have judiciously &ndash; that is, where they can most effectively and fairly be used to protect investors and our capital markets.&nbsp;This entails continuous review and monitoring of our docket to ensure we deploy our resources efficiently and refocus our priorities at the direction of the Commission. Put simply, we have focused and will continue to focus on bringing good cases that further the SEC&rsquo;s core mission.</p>
<p>Second.&nbsp;A principal focus of our enforcement program is thus to protect investors from the myriad fraud schemes cooked up by bad actors, which Chairman Atkins refers to as the liars, cheats, and thieves.&nbsp;Identifying, rooting out, and remedying scams, particularly those that inflict devastating costs on everyday retail investors, is the cornerstone of what we do.&nbsp;Our work will continue to focus on uncovering and deterring fraud that wipes out American investors&rsquo; retirement savings, or fraud that undercuts their progress towards saving for a home, or their kids&rsquo; education. And we will make full use of the remedies available to return money to investors harmed by those frauds.</p>
<p>Likewise, we will continue to charge violations of the securities laws for misconduct that clearly undermines market integrity, including accounting fraud, insider trading, wash trading, and market manipulation schemes.&nbsp;This critical work ensures that appropriate market forces, not bad actors, determine the value of securities.</p>
<p>Third, and lastly, I want to spend some time talking about compliance with other provisions of our federal securities laws, such as a public company&rsquo;s reporting requirements; its obligations to maintain adequate books and records and devise and maintain systems of internal accounting controls; or a broker-dealer or investment adviser&rsquo;s obligation to adhere to its fiduciary duties and financial responsibility rules.&nbsp;Whether a requirement is in a statute or promulgated using the Commission&rsquo;s rulemaking authority, enforcement of such rules is necessary to maintain the fairness of our capital markets.</p>
<p>Are violations of these provisions on par with fraud?&nbsp;No, not necessarily.&nbsp;In fact, I am confident that many violations of these provisions should not &ndash; and do not &ndash; result in enforcement cases by the Commission.&nbsp;But there is a middle ground: where fraud is absent, but compliance has failed in a way that poses risks to investors, risks to the integrity of the market, or yields a benefit to the participant.&nbsp;It is a place that may warrant enforcement action but may also present opportunity.&nbsp;Opportunity for both the Division and those who might be subject to an enforcement action to craft thoughtful resolutions in an appropriate case &ndash; resolutions that recognize wrongdoing while rectifying the violation or charting a firmer path toward compliance. Because &ndash; at the end of the day &ndash; our work in this space is about ensuring participants in our capital markets are providing investors with the necessary information and operating within the guardrails that make our capital markets the envy of the world.&nbsp;Where other divisions can identify, educate, and help people and entities remediate the problem or deficiency, fantastic.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ll end with this: in a perfect world, we wouldn&rsquo;t need a Division of Enforcement because we wouldn&rsquo;t have violations of our securities laws.&nbsp;But we do not live in a perfect world.&nbsp;Wrongdoing exists.&nbsp;And so long as it does, I am honored to help steer the ship &ndash; using the guiding principles I have described, and with careful and thoughtful stewardship of the formidable resources and power the federal government has entrusted to me &ndash; on behalf of those that rely on and participate in our capital markets.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention.&nbsp;I look forward to the discussion to follow.&nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<title>Deutsche Börse Group To Acquire General Atlantic’s Minority Stake In ISS STOXX</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has reached an agreement to acquire the remaining 20% minority stake in ISS STOXX, a leading data, analytics and index provider, held by General Atlantic, a leading global investor. This transaction marks the culmination of a successful partnership that began with the acquisition of Axioma in 2019, which provides analytics and risk solutions. It continued through the successful combination of ISS&rsquo; leading stewardship and ESG solutions and the STOXX index business in 2023.<br /><br />The buyout re-confirms Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group&rsquo;s strategic vision for ISS STOXX as a premier provider of mission-critical data, analytics, and indices especially for the buy-side. By acquiring the remaining shares, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group ensures the operational agility to simplify the implementation of its growth strategy for ISS STOXX and strengthens the go-to-market connectivity within the Group. As previously communicated by Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, ISS&rsquo; research and advisory offerings will continue to operate under previously established noninterference policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As previously communicated, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group and General Atlantic have been pursuing a dual track, allowing General Atlantic to exit until 2026. In line with the partnership agreements, today&rsquo;s transaction allows General Atlantic to sell its shares to Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group in the absence of a monetization possibility through an IPO. The valuation for this exit is in line with a pre-agreed peer-based multiple approach. The buyout price is set at ~20x times the adjusted EBITDA of ISS STOXX, resulting in a total purchase price consideration of &euro;1.1 billion payable in two tranches. The first tranche of &euro;731 million will become payable in February 2026 and the remaining tranche will be payable in March 2026. Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group will finance the transaction using available cash and debt financing at hand. The transaction is expected to have a low single-digit accretive effect on the Cash EPS for Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group in the first year of full ownership. General Atlantic&rsquo;s exit is expected to become effective at the end of March 2026. Following completion, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group expects to maintain its AA- long-term rating at the Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Christian Kromann, member of the Executive Board of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, said: "We are grateful for the partnership with General Atlantic. Their support and expertise have been invaluable for the successful merger that created ISS STOXX and the subsequent development of the business. This step now re-confirms our strategic ambition to empower the investment management industry with leading data, analytics, and index solutions. We look forward to building on the strong foundation we laid with General Atlantic as we further build-out the business as part of the Group&rsquo;s Investment Management Solutions."<br /><br />Gary Retelny, President and CEO of ISS STOXX, said: &ldquo;General Atlantic has been a constructive partner in building ISS STOXX, and we appreciate their support and insights over the past few years. As we now look forward with Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group as sole shareholder, our commitment remains unchanged. We will continue to provide clients with objective, high‑quality data, insights and solutions across governance, sustainability, market intelligence and indexing.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gabriel Caillaux, Co-President, Global Head of Climate, and Head of EMEA at General Atlantic, said: &ldquo;We are proud to have supported the development of ISS STOXX over time. The company has established itself as a fully integrated provider of buy-side intelligence, with a broadened and increasingly sophisticated index and analytics platform. We thank Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group for its partnership and look forward to following ISS STOXX&rsquo;s continued growth and success in the years ahead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>"Being first to trade&nbsp;CME Group's new Lumens (XLM) and LINK futures reinforces our focus on building institutional access to the next wave of&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;assets," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Harry Benchimol</span>, Co-Head of Derivatives Engine at Marex Solutions.

We are proud to be an active participant with CME Group to broaden access to institutional-grade&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;risk management."</p>
<p>"CME Group's continued expansion of listed&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;derivatives is a clear reflection of how institutional participation in&nbsp;<span>crypto</span>&nbsp;markets is evolving," said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Ethan Ren</span>, Head of Options at Wintermute Group.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has just published its preliminary financial results for 2025. Please scroll down for the link to the entire report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overview of the results:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Highest net revenue, EBITDA, net income, and earnings per share in the company's history &ndash; annual forecast fully met despite cyclical headwinds.</li>
<li>Due to strong operational growth, net revenue without treasury result, an important indicator for the Group, rose by 9 percent to &euro;5.2 billion in financial year 2025, as expected.</li>
<li>Operating costs, in contrast, rose by only 3 percent thanks to effective cost management.</li>
<li>EBITDA without treasury result rose disproportionately by 14 percent to &euro;2.7 billion.</li>
<li>The Executive Board is proposing a 5 percent increase in the dividend to &euro;4.20 per share for financial year 2025. In addition, a share buyback program with a volume of &euro;500 million has already been announced and will start shortly.</li>
<li>For the financial year 2026, the Group expects net revenue without treasury result to increase to around &euro;5.7 billion and EBITDA without treasury result to around &euro;3.1 billion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stephan Leithner, Chief Executive Officer of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, comments on the results as follows: &ldquo;In the past financial year, we have impressively demonstrated the strength and resilience of our diversified business portfolio. Strong secular growth more than offset the headwinds from the interest rate environment, low volatility, and currency effects. I would like to express my special thanks to our employees, who have contributed significantly to this success with their high level of commitment.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jens Schulte, Chief Financial Officer of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, adds: &ldquo;At the same time, we managed our costs very effectively, resulting in a significantly disproportionate increase in our operating profit. Our shareholders will benefit directly from this positive development: the total distribution, including share buybacks, will exceed last year's level and rise to a new record of &euro;1.3 billion.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the outlook,&nbsp;Stephan Leithner says: &ldquo;The 2025 result is an excellent starting point for our &lsquo;Leading the Transformation&rsquo; strategy. In this environment, which is characterized by fundamental changes both geopolitically and technologically, we are the reliable and innovative partner for critical financial infrastructure in Europe and across the globe. The secular growth drivers in our businesses remain fully intact. We therefore look ahead to the current financial year with confidence and expect to achieve our operating targets for 2026.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Testimony Before The U.S. House Financial Services Committee, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, Washington D.C., Feb. 11, 2026</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Chairman Hill, Ranking Member Waters, and Members of the Committee: It is an honor to testify before you today. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the work of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-testimony-hfsc-021126#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Nine months ago, I returned to the SEC with a clear mandate to recommit the agency to our core mission of protecting investors; maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitating capital formation. I am grateful to work alongside dedicated public servants who have hit the ground running in pursuit of these priorities.</p>
<p>America&rsquo;s $124.3 trillion capital markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world, leading both in market capitalization and trading volume. They are a marvel of human ingenuity. Yet over the years, the federal government&rsquo;s natural tendency has asserted itself, and rules have multiplied faster than the problems that they were intended to solve.</p>
<p>This Congress and the Trump Administration are focused on bringing down the cost of living for the American people, and the SEC has a vital role to play. For example, public companies spend $2.7 billion a year to file their annual reports. This is $2.7 billion that companies are not reinvesting in their businesses to create jobs. $2.7 billion that our disclosure regime is diverting from your constituents to corporate lawyers, accountants, and consultants.</p>
<p>Now, this is not to say that we want to gut corporate disclosure, which is vital. But we must modernize, rationalize, and streamline reports so that they are meaningful, understandable, and not a repellant to investors. After all, how many of you would read through an annual filing that rivals&nbsp;<em>War and Peace</em>? Disclosure documents of that length can do more to obscure than to illuminate.</p>
<p>As I have stated previously, regulation ideally should be smart, effective, and appropriately tailored within the confines of our statutory authority. Instead, it has made the path to public ownership narrower, costlier, and saddled with rules that can create more friction than benefit.</p>
<p>For context, shortly after I left the SEC in the mid-1990s, there were more than 7,800 companies listed on the U.S. exchanges. By the time that I returned as Chairman, that figure had fallen by roughly 40 percent.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-testimony-hfsc-021126#_ftn2">[2]</a></p>
<p>This trajectory tells a cautionary tale of regulatory creep that the SEC is working to rectify through the three pillars of my plan to make IPOs great again: first, re-anchoring disclosures in materiality so that investment decisions can turn on economic signals rather than on regulatory noise; second, de-politicizing shareholder meetings by restoring their focus to significant corporate matters; and third, allowing public companies to have litigation alternatives so that we shield innovators from the frivolous and investors from the fraudulent. I also applaud the bipartisan initiatives that you are considering in Congress, including those in the Senate&rsquo;s Empowering Main Street in America Act and the House&rsquo;s INVEST Act, to help keep America&rsquo;s capital markets open, dynamic, and, above all, worthy of the trust that investors place in them.</p>
<p>Of course, I also support congressional efforts to enact the CLARITY Act. Upon its passage, the Commission stands ready to implement this landmark legislation. A federal framework for crypto markets is long overdue. Under Commissioner Hester Peirce&rsquo;s leadership of our Crypto Task Force, SEC staff has provided more clarity in the past year than in the prior decade, but there is no action we can take that future-proofs our rulebook more formidably than nonpartisan market structure legislation.</p>
<p>As Congress completes its vital work, CFTC Chairman Mike Selig and I intend to provide a bridge toward legislation. Through our now-joint Project Crypto, we will consider a token taxonomy to offer both investors and innovators a clear understanding of their regulatory obligations. We will also look to consider exemptions that would allow market participants to move and transact on-chain.</p>
<p>Now, as we modernize oversight for digital assets, we must also reassess whether our legacy tools for traditional markets remain appropriately aligned with regulatory need and the public interest, which brings me to the Consolidated Audit Trail (CAT). I have directed SEC staff to conduct a comprehensive review of the CAT, which will consider, among other things, issues related to governance, funding, potential cost-savings measures (including potential retirement of duplicative systems), design, functionality, scope, regulatory use, and security. As the staff undertake this review, I note that the Commission has already taken steps to meaningfully reduce the costs of the CAT system which, when established in November 2016, estimated to total, at the upper end, about $55 million annually. Thanks in part to an amendment to the CAT NMS Plan approved by the Commission in 2024 and conditional exemptive relief issued by the Commission in 2025, we have reduced the originally-approved CAT budget for 2025&mdash;which included approximately $249 million in annual operating costs&mdash;by approximately $92 million over the course of the year.</p>
<p>The Commission has also recently approved amendments to the CAT NMS Plan with respect to the Customer and Account Information System that self-regulatory organizations (SROs) state would result in an approximately $7-9 million in cost savings annually. In addition, the SROs recently proposed further amendments to the CAT NMS Plan to implement certain measures that would further reduce costs significantly.</p>
<p>Those cost reductions reflect the SEC&rsquo;s broader commitment to disciplined oversight across our regulatory ecosystem. In January 2026, for example, the SEC approved the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) budget, totaling $362.1 million&mdash;a 9.4 percent ($37.6 million) decrease from the prior year, including a 52 percent and 42 percent reduction in the Chairman&rsquo;s and other Board members&rsquo; compensation, respectively.</p>
<p>As the SEC and the PCAOB often work closely on matters important to our capital markets, I am also pleased that the Commission recently appointed new Board members who bring a wide variety of experiences to their service. When we began the search process, I highlighted the role that the PCAOB plays in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public companies through oversight of auditing firms, and thus the broader public markets, in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies and broker-dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget. The newly appointed Chairman and Board Members have already demonstrated a profound commitment to protecting investors and responsible use of such funds by accepting compensation much more in line with the ethos of public service. The Chairman has extensive experience in management of a large organization and examinations work. I am confident that this new Board will usher in a new day at the PCAOB&mdash;one of sensible, more effective, and more efficient oversight of auditors.</p>
<p>Finally, and most fundamentally, capital markets thrive on many factors, but they endure on the trust of those who participate in them. Investor protection is at the core of what brings us to work each day. And to fulfill that charge, the SEC is returning its enforcement program to first principles of rooting out fraud and remedying investor harm.</p>
<p>Since I rejoined the Commission last year, we have brought enforcement actions to address offering frauds, insider trading, accounting and financial frauds, and breaches of fiduciary duty by investment advisers. In the fall, meanwhile, we announced the Division of Enforcement&rsquo;s Cross-Border Task Force to strengthen and enhance our efforts to identify and combat cross-border fraud. Since September, we have suspended trading in the stocks of fourteen Asia-based issuers on evidence of potential manipulation designed to artificially inflate the price and volume of the securities. I am working within the securities laws to protect investors from those who seek to use international borders to evade and undermine U.S. investor protections. Markets are global. Investor protection must be as well.</p>
<p>As I said at the outset of this testimony, the SEC is returning to a core mission that remains as vital today as it was when Congress first set it for us over 90 years ago. So, I want to thank this Committee once again for convening today&rsquo;s hearing. I look forward to answering your questions and to our shared work ahead. Thank you.</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of Justice: Virtual Asset Trading Platform Sentenced For Violating The Travel Act And Other Federal Criminal Charges</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-justice-virtual-asset-trading-platform-sentenced-for-violati-2026211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/us-department-of-justice-virtual-asset-trading-platform-sentenced-for-violati-2026211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Paxful Holdings Inc., an online virtual currency trading platform, was sentenced yesterday to pay a criminal penalty of $4 million based on its ability to pay following its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/virtual-asset-trading-platform-pleads-guilty-violating-travel-act-and-other-federal-criminal">guilty plea</a>&nbsp;to conspiracies to promote illegal prostitution, violate the Bank Secrecy Act, and knowingly transmit funds derived from criminal offenses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paxful profited from moving money for criminals that it attracted by touting its lack of anti-money laundering controls and failure to comply with applicable money-laundering laws, all while knowing that these criminals were engaged in fraud, extortion, prostitution and commercial sex trafficking,&rdquo; said Assistant Attorney General A. Tysen Duva of the Justice Department&rsquo;s Criminal Division. &ldquo;Crimes like this are a high priority for the Criminal Division because criminal money transmitters facilitate so many other crimes like money laundering, prostitution, fraud, romance scams, extortion and human trafficking. This sentence shows that companies will be held accountable when they create safe havens for criminal activity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sentence holds the company accountable for knowingly allowing its platform to facilitate serious criminal conduct,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Eric Grant for the Eastern District of California. &ldquo;By putting profit over compliance, the company enabled money laundering and other crimes. This sentence sends a clear message: companies that turn a blind eye to criminal activity on their platforms will face serious consequences under U.S. law. The U.S. Attorney&rsquo;s Office will continue to protect victims and ensure that the cryptocurrency ecosystem is not exploited by criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sentencing underscores IRS Criminal Investigation&rsquo;s (IRS-CI) unwavering commitment to holding accountable those who exploit financial systems to facilitate criminal activity,&rdquo; said Special Agent in Charge Linda Nguyen of the IRS-CI Oakland Field Office. &ldquo;Paxful&rsquo;s deliberate disregard for anti-money laundering requirements and its role in promoting illegal prostitution and other criminal schemes enabled the movement of illicit funds at scale. This case sends a clear message: platforms that choose profit over compliance will face serious consequences and be brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to court documents, Paxful Inc., and later, Paxful Holdings Inc. (collectively Paxful), owned and operated an online peer-to-peer virtual currency platform and money transmitting business (MTB) where customers negotiated for and traded virtual currency for a variety of other items, including currency like cash, pre-paid cards and gift cards. Paxful knew that its customers transmitted funds from criminal offenses, including fraud schemes and illegal prostitution. From Jan. 1, 2017, to Sept. 2, 2019, Paxful facilitated more than 26.7 million trades, totaling nearly $3 billion in value, and collected more than $29.7 million in revenue.</p>
<p>Paxful knowingly transferred virtual currency on behalf of its customers, including Backpage, an online advertising platform for illicit prostitution and similar sites. In various criminal proceedings, Backpage and its owners and operators admitted that Backpage advertised and profited from illegal prostitution, including illegal sex work depicting minors. Paxful&rsquo;s founders boasted about the &ldquo;Backpage Effect,&rdquo; which enabled the business to grow. Between December 2015 and December 2022, Paxful&rsquo;s collaboration with Backpage and a similar site caused nearly $17 million worth of bitcoin to be transferred from the Paxful wallet to Backpage and the copycat site from which Paxful obtained at least $2.7 million in profits.</p>
<p>As described in the plea agreement, from July 2015 to June 2019, Paxful and its founders marketed Paxful as a platform that did not require know-your-customer (KYC) information; allowed customers to open accounts and trade on the Paxful platform without gathering sufficient KYC information; presented to third parties fake AML policies that they knew were not implemented or enforced; and failed to file suspicious activity reports, despite knowing that Paxful users were engaged in suspicious and criminal activity. As a result, Paxful knew it was used as a vehicle for prostitution, fraud, romance scams and extortion schemes.</p>
<p>Paxful pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Travel Act by promoting illegal prostitution through interstate commerce; conspiring to operate an unlicensed MTB by knowingly transmitting funds derived from criminal offenses or supporting unlawful activity, including illegal prostitution and fraud schemes; and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act&rsquo;s (BSA) anti-money laundering (AML) program requirement. As a result of its illegal conduct, the virtual currency platform was used to transfer the proceeds of fraud schemes, illegal prostitution, hacks by malign state actors and distribution of child sexual abuse material.</p>
<p>The Justice Department reached its resolution with Paxful based on several factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offenses, which involved Paxful&rsquo;s processing of millions of dollars of illicit transactions. Paxful did not make a timely and voluntary disclosure of wrongdoing, but it received credit for its cooperation with the department&rsquo;s investigation, including among other things, collecting, analyzing and producing voluminous information, providing timely updates on facts learned during its internal investigation and engaging in extensive and timely remedial measures. According to court documents, Paxful agreed that the appropriate criminal penalty based on the law and the facts in its case is $112,500,000. Based on the Justice Department&rsquo;s independent analysis, it determined that Paxful did not have the ability to pay a criminal penalty greater than $4 million.</p>
<p>On July 8, 2024, Paxful&rsquo;s co-founder and former chief technology officer, Artur Schaback,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/paxful-inc-co-founder-pleads-guilty-conspiracy-fail-maintain-effective-anti-money-laundering">pleaded guilty</a>&nbsp;to conspiracy to fail to maintain an effective AML program in relation to the same scheme.</p>
<p>Paxful&rsquo;s guilty plea was part of a coordinated resolution with FinCEN.</p>
<p>HSI and IRS-CI are investigating the case.</p>
<p>Bank Integrity Unit Deputy Chief Kevin Mosley and Trial Attorneys Emily Cohen, Caylee Campbell and Katherine Nielsen of the Criminal Division&rsquo;s Money Laundering, Narcotics and Forfeiture Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Thuesen for the Eastern District of California are prosecuting the case.</p>
<p>The Money Laundering, Narcotics and Forfeiture Section&rsquo;s Bank Integrity Unit investigates and prosecutes banks and other financial institutions, including their officers, managers and employees whose actions threaten the integrity of the individual institution or the wider financial system.</p>

<div class="bw-subheadline-wrapper">
<ul>
<li><i>Normalizes and structures Polymarket data</i><i>for professional and institutional investors</i></li>
<li><i style="font-family: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">ICE to become exclusive provider for institutional capital markets</i></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of the Polymarket Signals and Sentiment tool, delivering prediction market data and analytics. ICE will become the exclusive provider of this data for institutional capital markets.</p>
<p>Polymarket is the world&rsquo;s largest prediction market, which includes prediction markets that are related or adjacent to financial and commodity markets. ICE now offers normalized data feeds representing Polymarket&rsquo;s prediction markets, enabling professional and institutional traders to consume crowd-sourced probability assessments as market signals. These signals indicate implied probabilities on real-world outcomes that are not typically captured by financial instruments and are designed to complement traditional market, pricing, and sentiment inputs within institutional workflows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polymarket&rsquo;s prediction markets have ushered in an entirely new way to look at the world around us, and with billions in trading volumes, they are allowing us to structure dynamic views of key market-moving economic, political, and market events from unstructured datasets in a way previously difficult for institutional capital market participants to use,&rdquo; said Chris Edmonds, President of ICE&rsquo;s Fixed Income and Data Services. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s so rare for new datasets like this to become available at such a quick pace, but with our sophisticated AI and data science experience, we&rsquo;re able to normalize the data to help our customers convert the wisdom of those markets into signals that they can use to develop alpha generation strategies and manage risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As prediction markets mature, their value to institutional investors becomes clearer,&rdquo; said Shayne Coplan, Founder and CEO of Polymarket. &ldquo;These markets reflect collective expectations on market-moving events in near real time and have quickly emerged as a credible input alongside traditional data sources. Working with ICE helps ensure that those signals can be accessed, interpreted, and applied in a way that can be used as a resource for institutional market participants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s Polymarket Signals and Sentiment service aggregates and normalizes data, bringing it to customers in a structured environment that matches the way they access markets and trade. The service is delivered through ICE&rsquo;s existing data infrastructure, with near real-time access via the ICE Consolidated Feed and historical time-series data available through ICE Consolidated History to support backtesting and quantitative analysis.</p>
<p>The tool leverages ICE&rsquo;s extensive entity identification and reference databases to map Polymarket signals to specific securities or companies, allowing customers to integrate it with existing ICE data offerings, including securities pricing, fundamental data and corporate actions.</p>
<p>This data is part of ICE&rsquo;s recently launched Signals &amp; Sentiment service, which includes data and analytics from Reddit, Dow Jones and now Polymarket.</p>
<p>For more information on Polymarket Signals and Sentiment, please visit:&nbsp;<a href="https://ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/data-and-analytics/market-signals-and-sentiment" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">https://ice.com/fixed-income-data-services/data-and-analytics/market-signals-and-sentiment</a>.</p>

<p><span>Two and Signicat address a persistent challenge in the British and European B2B commerce landscape. While digital identity verification for consumers is mature, with established national schemes like BankID and MitID used widely, and corporate credit checks are routine, the link between the two remains a critical point of friction. The process of confirming that an individual buyer is authorized to transact on behalf of their company still frequently requires manual intervention, creating transaction delays, increasing fraud risk, and leading to lost revenue from abandoned sales.</span></p>
<p><span><i>"We call it the authority gap,"&nbsp;</i>said&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://click.agilitypr.delivery/ls/click?upn=u001.HR5yxCXOtOlbIz1dI0tMVFAJxvlfWEAFN30NkqgK3ewteNXzoYlEC0PVaehqWenlBr3nK8ytLynAedseYHy1hw-3D-3DZnkK_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9-2FOaFosdYBMkphylCmORvqG3Qqzyk5Yq0PQ3KDByrEtISrpJTzBUM3PmExj-2FeQpFkbWn4seV-2BRq84NSuqKK8GaReAKSBmnXbtvYoaQY3FWzLDGD9yq8oq6SAmHIRAuSP2zHse3WJO-2FrvkFaTnqxFAim3a4aGA5ovOHnrQsAu5f2-2F-2BBYTMmRGk-2FNf3-2BMNVUV1KL-2B32NRkNYTXEq85j847HQU75MgXGMrvardqCgfc56seYN2Ll-2FjiXUgNGZ7nOpSylAWvHZ-2BUDmtdBRd1-2F0n9W1OwnRfx5y1edfBD-2BxppUT-2FtmhFk-2B3WKa7uuACVkDcybtsYRRm9nHFNe8ncIZ21l4JeZZ1iYdrJL-2Fj6ASq9iqQqIUHtxoNQCPUM-2FBgIrXF2duAdR4jT4KfUYGpdHgbEvNjg8fRoFho-2Bjq-2BDAsBaOXX0Y-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Andreas Mjelde</span></a><span>, CEO and co-founder of Two<i>. "A British distributor can instantly verify that a buyer is a real person named Maria Garc&iacute;a. They can check that Garc&iacute;a Industrial S.L. is a legitimate Spanish company. But can Maria commit Garc&iacute;a Industrial S.L. to net-60 terms on a five-figure order? Until now, answering that question meant days of back-and-forth with documents and phone calls. We've collapsed that to seconds."</i></span></p>
<p><span>The partnership lets Two's B2B payment and risk platform connect to Signicat's identity platform, allowing it to orchestrate a full suite of verification methods. This process combines personal identity proofing, using methods that range from established national eID schemes to modern electronic identity document verification with biometrics, with real-time data lookups from official company registries. As a result, when a business buyer authenticates, the system simultaneously confirms their individual identity and cross-references their legal authority to transact on behalf of the company.</span></p>

<title>IOSCO Announces Pre-Valentine’s Day Campaign Focused On Combatting Relationship Investments Scams</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-announces-pre-valentines-day-campaign-focused-on-combatting-relationship-2026211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/iosco-announces-pre-valentines-day-campaign-focused-on-combatting-relationship-2026211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The International Organization of Securities Commission (IOSCO) announces the start of a worldwide initiative to raise awareness about&nbsp;<strong>relationship investment scams</strong>&nbsp;and the devastating effect they can have on an investor&rsquo;s financial future.</p>
<p>These scams are called various names, including romance scams, crypto investment scams, financial grooming scams, and &ldquo;pig butchering&rdquo; scams. They involve a &ldquo;long con&rdquo; where fraudsters target people through wrong-number texts, dating apps, and social media over time to&nbsp;<strong>build trust</strong>&nbsp;through friendship, romance, or an offer to help them achieve their financial goals.</p>
<p>As the world celebrates love and connection, the campaign that runs from 11 February to 14 February, 2026 encourages the public to learn how to recognize relationship investment scams and share the information to warn others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone can fall victim to a scam, especially in a world of fast-moving new technologies. With investor protection as a cornerstone of IOSCO&rsquo;s mission, this campaign aims to alert retail investors to the warning signs of a scam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Jean-Paul Servais</strong>, IOSCO Board Chair</em></p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeated, continuous, and concerted awareness efforts have the power to foster essential investor vigilance against fraud. This initiative is further proof of IOSCO members' genuine commitment to financial protection and education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em><strong>Camille Beaudoin</strong>, Director, Financial Education Expertise and Partnerships, AMF Qu&eacute;bec and Chair of IOSCO&rsquo;s Committee on Investor Education</em></p>
<p>After the relationship is established, fraudsters claim to know about profitable investment opportunities. Individuals are then directed to a legitimate looking (but fake) investing website or app. Once individuals have invested all their money, the &ldquo;new friend&rdquo; disappears, and so does their money.</p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are estimated to have caused the loss of tens of billions of dollars globally. This campaign aims to inform investors about the&nbsp;<strong>warning signs of the scams</strong>&nbsp;and help empower them with information to protect themselves and those they care about:</p>
<p><strong>Red Flags</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Unsolicited investment advice and opportunities.</li>
<li>Conversations that are moved off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps or to an unmonitored space.</li>
<li>A prolonged inability to meet in person.</li>
<li>Repeated suggestions for investments or requests for money.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Protect Yourself</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ignore, delete, and block messages from senders you don&rsquo;t know.</li>
<li>Make investment decisions independent of the advice of someone who makes unsolicited contact with you online or through an app or text message.</li>
<li>Research investment opportunities thoroughly.</li>
<li>Protect information about your identity and personal finances.</li>
<li>Never pay money to recover your investment or to release funds.</li>
</ul>

(AEOTrade) have entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). Together, they will explore how verifiable organizational identity can promote the development of an open, inclusive, and secure infrastructure for trusted global digital trade.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">AEOTrade is a technology enterprise serving the trade industry. Under the MoU, GLEIF and AEOTrade will work to promote interoperability between different global digital identity standards &ndash; including the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) and the verifiable LEI (vLEI) &ndash; and international digital trade protocols, such as the AEOTradeChain blockchain platform. By integrating the vLEI with its AEOTradeChain platform, AEOTrade's solution creates a trusted digital infrastructure that ensures the authenticity, uniqueness and compliance of every electronic bill of lading (eBL) and verifies the identities of all participants. This significantly enhances the security, accuracy, and efficiency of global trade processes and supply chains.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">The collaboration follows AEOTrade's participation in the inaugural GLEIF vLEI Hackathon, where it was recognized as the runner-up in the Trade, Supply Chain, and SME Finance category.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>Alexandre Kech, CEO at GLEIF, comments</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>: &ldquo;Global trade continues to face fundamental challenges related to trust, fragmentation, and inefficiency&mdash;particularly as critical documents such as electronic bills of lading move fully into digital form. This collaboration with AEOTrade demonstrates how verifiable organizational identity, anchored in the vLEI, can help address these issues at scale by ensuring that every participant and transaction can be trusted by default. Building on previous cooperation during the vLEI Hackathon, the MoU marks a clear step toward real-world deployment and a more secure, interoperable digital trade ecosystem.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>Zetao Yang, CEO, AEOTrade and Secretary General of TradeTech Alliance</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-US"><span>, said: &ldquo;Having showcased the benefits of integrating the vLEI into key trade documentation and processes, our ongoing engagement with GLEIF stands to promote interoperability and innovation to realize new use-cases and enable trusted and efficient cross-border commerce."</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><span lang="EN-US">GLEIF and AEOTrade will also focus on accelerating the development of real-world use-cases, as well as exploring broader opportunities to increase collaboration and advance the global digital trade technology ecosystem.</span></span></span></span></p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: New Protections Confirmed For Buy Now Pay Later Borrowers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-new-protections-confirmed-for-buy-now-pay-later-2026211/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) borrowers will benefit from stronger protections from 15 July 2026, following the Government's decision to bring the sector under the FCA's regulation.</p>
<p>BNPL will be subject to the Consumer Duty and consumers will benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Clear information</span>: Consumers will get clear, upfront details about their agreement, including when payments will be due, amounts, and what happens if they miss a payment.</li>
<li><span>Affordability checks</span>: Lenders must carry out proportionate checks to make sure customers can afford to repay what they borrow before offering BNPL.</li>
<li><span>Support when needed</span>: Lenders will need to offer support to customers in financial difficulty, and, where appropriate, direct them to free debt advice.</li>
<li><span>Complaints and compensation</span>: If something goes wrong, consumers will be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.</li>
</ul>
<p>BNPL provides an important source of credit for many, but there are no protections in place currently for those who use it repeatedly and may not be able to afford it. The aim of the new regulation is to help consumers navigate their financial lives, with appropriate support for consumers.</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We want the Buy Now Pay Later sector to thrive &ndash; it provides an important source of credit to many &ndash; and we will continue to support firms who want to develop innovative new products. But crucially, no one should be lent to if they're unable to repay, because that could worsen their financial situation. Now Parliament has given us the powers, we&rsquo;re putting in place proportionate protections for the 11 million people who use it.'</p>
<p>Lenders will need to be authorised by the FCA to provide BNPL. The FCA will provide pre-application support to these firms to help them get ready.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>BNPL is a broad term which can include credit agreements that are already regulated. The final rules relate to unregulated BNPL agreements, which are defined as deferred payment credit (DPC) in the legislation and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/policy-statements/ps26-1-regulation-deferred-payment-credit" title="PS26/1: Regulation of Deferred Payment Credit (unregulated Buy Now Pay Later)">Policy Statement</a>.</li>
<li>Firms will be able to register for the temporary permissions regime between 15 May 2026 and 1 July 2026. Firms will have 6 months (from the date the regime comes into force) to apply for full authorisation.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/regulating-buy-now-pay-later" title="Regulating Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL)">Find out more about what firms need to do</a>.</li>
<li>The BNPL market has grown significantly in recent years, from &pound;0.06bn in 2017 to over &pound;13bn in 2024. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/financial-lives/financial-lives-2024" title="Financial Lives 2024 survey">FCA&rsquo;s 2024 Financial Lives Survey</a>, 20% of UK consumers (10.9 million adults) used it in the 12 months leading up to May 2024.</li>
<li>Where consumers can afford to use BNPL, and it can work for them in the ways it&rsquo;s meant to &ndash; for example, managing cash flow &ndash; they should be able to access it. While firms have a responsibility to check that consumers can afford to repay before offering BNPL, consumers should remember that BNPL is borrowing and make sure they can afford the repayments. If you&rsquo;re struggling with money, you can get guidance on&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">dealing with debt<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;from MoneyHelper. You can also use the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en/money-troubles/dealing-with-debt/debt-advice-locator" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">Debt Advice Locator tool<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to find free services in your area.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/buy-now-pay-later" title="Buy Now Pay Later">Find out more about BNPL</a>.</li>
<li>Suppliers that provide their own credit will remain exempt from regulation. The exemption of 'merchant own credit' was a decision the Government made in 2024.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Juspay, a global leader in payment infrastructure solutions for enterprises and banks, today announced its expansion into the Middle East with the opening of its regional headquarters in Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC). This move marks an important step in Juspay&rsquo;s international expansion, deepening its focus on serving enterprise merchants, banks, and financial institutions in the Middle East. The DIFC headquarters will support closer engagement with existing partners as enterprise payment demand continues to scale.</span></p>
<p><span>With digital commerce accelerating in the GCC region, rapidly scaling enterprises in sectors such as airlines, hospitality, e-commerce, and financial services face increasing complexity driven by multiple regional currencies, evolving regulations, and diverse local payment methods.</span></p>
<p><span>To address this complexity, Juspay&rsquo;s payments orchestration platform provides a unified &amp; reliable payments stack, helping organizations optimize authorisation rates and costs, simplify compliance and scale seamlessly across GCC and global markets with institutional-grade reliability.</span></p>

<p><span>Commenting on the expansion,&nbsp;<span>Sheetal Lalwani</span>,&nbsp;<span>Co-founder &amp; COO of Juspay</span>, said: &ldquo;Juspay has been building foundational payments infrastructure for large-scale, mission-critical commerce globally for over a decade. We are excited to bring these learnings to the Middle East and partner with merchants, banks, networks, and the broader ecosystem to build secure, scalable payments infrastructure that supports the region&rsquo;s rapidly evolving digital economy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Salmaan Jaffery, Chief Business Development Officer at DIFC Authority</span></span><span>&nbsp;said: "We are pleased to welcome Juspay to the Middle East, Africa and South Asia&rsquo;s most significant fintech and financial services ecosystem. As a global leader in payment infrastructure, Juspay's presence strengthens our growing digital economy, reinforces DIFC's role as a catalyst for financial innovation and cements Dubai&rsquo;s position as a top four global FinTech hub.&rdquo;</span></p>

<title>Shanghai Stock Exchange Introduces New Measures To Facilitate Follow-On Offering</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/shanghai-stock-exchange-introduces-new-measures-to-facilitate-follow-on-offering-2026211/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/shanghai-stock-exchange-introduces-new-measures-to-facilitate-follow-on-offering-2026211/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the 20th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China calls for enhancing the inclusiveness and adaptability of the capital market and improving the coordinated functions of investment and financing. The 2025 Central Economic Work Conference requests continuous and in-depth reforms to the investment and financing mechanisms of the capital market. Follow-on offering, as one of the crucial investment and financing tools, plays a significant role in the growth of listed companies and efficient resource allocation.</p>
<p>To act on the guidance of the Fourth Plenary Session and the Central Economic Work Conference, Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) introduces new measures to facilitate follow-on offering in line with its core tasks of preventing risks, enhancing regulation, and promoting high-quality development. These measures aim to make follow-on offering more flexible and easy, thereby boosting innovation and fostering new quality productive forces. The measures are centered around the following principles:&nbsp;<span>First</span>, taking measures specific to meeting targets and addressing problems, focusing on issues that undermine the effects of follow-on offering and are widely raised by stakeholders, optimizing follow-on offering mechanisms, and further improving the quality and efficiency of follow-on offering reviews.&nbsp;<span>Second</span>, prioritizing support for high-quality and innovative companies, enhancing policy support for high-quality listed companies in follow-on offering, and guiding market resources to areas of new quality productive forces.&nbsp;<span>Third</span>, adopting a holistic approach, placing risk prevention and enhanced regulation at the forefront, and striving to build a dynamic and orderly market environment.&nbsp;<span>Fourth</span>, maintaining a steady and progressive approach to ensure the smooth and effective implementation of the measures. The specific measures are as follows:</p>
<p><span>First, further support high-quality listed companies in innovation and development.</span>&nbsp;The SSE will optimize the follow-on offering review process and improve efficiency for high-quality listed companies with standardized operation, governance, and information disclosure, as well as high market recognition and representativeness. The principle of selecting the best among the best and prioritizing quality over quantity will be upheld. High-quality listed companies will be supported in using proceeds for developing new industries, business models, and technologies that synergize with their main businesses. Support will also be given to investments in second-growth-engine businesses, but reckless crossover or diversification attempts will be prohibited.</p>
<p><span>Second, better adapt to the follow-on offering needs of high-tech innovative companies.</span>&nbsp;Formulate a "light assets and high R&amp;D investment" criterion for companies listed on the Main Board. Revise the interval requirement between following-on offering activities. For high-tech companies that were loss-making when listing and are still not profitable, if the proceeds raised from the previous offering are substantially used up or if there has been no change in the intended use of the proceeds, they may initiate procedures such as announcing a follow-on offering proposal six months after the funds from the previous offering were received. Listed companies whose stock price has fallen below the issuance price may engage in reasonable fundraising through methods such as competitive-bid private placements and convertible bonds, provided that the raised funds will be used for their main business.</p>
<p><span>Third, make follow-on offering process more flexible and easy.</span>&nbsp;When a listed company discloses a follow-on offering proposal, it should briefly disclose how proceeds from previous offering are used and the plan for remaining funds. At the time of application, the previously raised proceeds should have been substantially used up. Content already disclosed in periodic reports and other documents can be directly referenced in the follow-on offering application materials as long as there has been no change in facts. The negative list for the simplified follow-on offering procedure will be revised.</p>
<p><span>Fourth, strengthen oversight of the entire follow-on offering process.</span>&nbsp;The listed companies and intermediaries shall strictly fulfill their duties as the disclosure obligator and the "gatekeeper". A work mechanism for disclosing follow-on offering proposals on the stock exchange shall be established to rigorously prevent listed companies from seeking follow-on financing amidst unresolved problems. Listed companies shall make timely decisions and promptly submit applications after disclosing their follow-on offering proposals. Requirements for announcing follow-on offering proposals will be adjusted. For fixed-price private placements aimed at obtaining control of a listed company, both the listed company and the target investors are required to make a public commitment to finalize the offering before the approval letter expires. Stricter oversight of raised proceeds will be imposed. Violations such as unauthorized changes to the use of proceeds or unilaterally extend the period for temporarily supplementing working capital will be held accountable. The SSE will intensify both ongoing and ex-post supervision, and take strict actions against any illegal or non-compliant activities in follow-on offering.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of China Securities Regulatory Commission, the SSE will accelerate the rule-making and facilitate exemplary deals, and further improve the flexibility and convenience of follow-on offering, thereby enhancing the market's sense of gain.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission Cautions Against Ramp And Dump Schemes Involving Impersonation Of Stock Commentators</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/hong-kong-securities-and-futures-commission-cautions-against-ramp-and-dump-schem-2026211/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) urges the public to remain vigilant against investment scams involving fraudsters impersonating well-known stock commentators claiming to offer investment advices that guarantee high returns. In recent cases reported to the SFC, scammers lured victims, through social media platforms and instant messaging apps, into participating in ramp and dump schemes &ndash; a form of stock market manipulation.</p>
<p>In a typical ramp and dump scheme, fraudsters aggressively promote and &ldquo;ramp&rdquo; up the price of small-cap or less liquid stocks, often presenting themselves as reputable market experts. They may offer so-called &ldquo;inside information&rdquo; or investment tips, encouraging investors to buy the shares at artificially inflated prices. Once the price is ramped up, the fraudsters then quickly &ldquo;dump&rdquo; their holdings, selling at an elevated price and leaving the victim investors exposed to significant losses as the share price collapses. There are also cases where victims were lured into trading on fraudulent platforms or apps, on which investors reported difficulties with asset withdrawal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On some occasions, the fraudsters approached the victims after they suffered losses, claiming that &ldquo;compensation&rdquo; may be arranged upon payment of additional &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; or &ldquo;handling fees&rdquo;. When the victims had transferred funds into the designated accounts, the fraudsters broke off contact with the victims.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, investors do not know the true identities of the people who urge them to buy the stock or the reliability of the information they provide. Scammers may use fake social media profiles, counterfeit documents, or impersonate trusted commentators to gain credibility.</p>
<p>The SFC has reported these cases to the Police, and will continue to join forces with other law enforcement agencies to crack down on investment scams.</p>
<p><span>The SFC strongly advises the investing public to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Be especially wary of offers that seem &ldquo;too good to be true&rdquo; on social media or messaging apps.</li>
<li>Exercise extreme caution against unsolicited investment advice, especially an online &ldquo;friend&rdquo; asks you to send a screenshot of your trading record.</li>
<li>Use only official company payment channels and always verify the recipients&rsquo; identities by confirming their details through trusted sources. Avoid depositing funds to individual bank accounts.</li>
<li>Report any suspicious investment activity, impersonation, or ramp and dump schemes to the SFC or the Police immediately.</li>
</ul>

<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced the launch of Cryptocurrency futures contracts based on seven CoinDesk Indices including CoinDesk 20 and CoinDesk 5 Indices. The contracts include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>ICE CoinDesk 20 Index Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk 5 Index Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Bitcoin Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Ether Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk Solana Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk XRP Futures</li>
<li>ICE CoinDesk BNB Futures</li>
</ul>
<p>The CoinDesk indexed contracts are U.S. dollar denominated and cash-settled. Over $40 billion in assets under management are tied to CoinDesk Indices tracking the price of cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin, Ether and Solana.</p>
<p>The flagship CoinDesk 20 Index tracks the performance of digital assets, including Bitcoin, BNB, Ethereum and Solana using a capped market capitalization-weighted methodology to ensure broad exposure and diversification benefits across all constituents. Over 90% of the digital asset market is captured by the CoinDesk 20 Index and the total volume of linked products is worth over $16 billion. The CoinDesk 5 Index is market capitalization-weighted and tracks the performance of the five largest constituents of the CoinDesk 20.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The digital asset space is evolving rapidly, and we are excited to collaborate with CoinDesk to launch these new futures contracts,&rdquo; said Jennifer Ilkiw, President of ICE Futures U.S. &ldquo;The launch expands ICE&rsquo;s existing relationship with CoinDesk and will bring further transparency to the digital asset market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;CoinDesk Indices were built to serve as trusted benchmarks for the digital asset sector, and this launch with ICE advances that mission into regulated futures markets,&rdquo; said David LaValle, President of CoinDesk Data and Indices. &ldquo;The partnership expands the reach of our benchmarks while offering market participants familiar, transparent, and reliable ways to engage with digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE plans to launch One Month CoinDesk Overnight Rates (CDOR) USDC futures based on CoinDesk&rsquo;s Overnight Rate, subject to regulatory review. CDOR rates are daily benchmarks that reflect the annualized effective interest rate paid by borrowers in decentralized finance markets and are structurally similar to traditional overnight rates like SOFR or &euro;STR.</p>

<p align="left"><strong>Highlights</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Product Expansion Fueled Strong Momentum in 2025 as Robinhood Grew Across Strategic Priorities</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 Platform for Active Traders</strong>&nbsp;- Robinhood accelerated momentum with active traders as it expanded product offerings, led by Prediction Markets, with over 12 billion event contracts traded in 2025. Deepening its investment in Prediction Markets, Robinhood established a joint venture,&nbsp;Rothera, LLC&nbsp;("Rothera"), in partnership with&nbsp;Susquehanna International Group, that acquired MIAXdx in&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;to advance the build out of an independent, CFTC-licensed exchange and clearinghouse. In December, the Company also hosted Robinhood Presents: YES/NO, announcing new features for the Prediction Markets Hub - such as preset and custom combos and player contracts - and expanded Robinhood Cortex capabilities, including the next generation of its AI-powered investing assistant and portfolio-level Digests. In addition, the Company began rolling out short selling in mid-November, which has already seen billions of notional volume traded by customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 in Wallet Share for the&nbsp;Next Generation</strong>&nbsp;- Robinhood drove greater share of wallet across long-term investing by deepening customer adoption of the Company&rsquo;s retirement, advisory and banking offerings. This quarter, Robinhood Gold Subscribers grew to 4.2&nbsp;million, with the adoption rate exceeding 15%, reflecting strong demand for premium features and differentiated benefits. Additionally, Robinhood Retirement AUC more than doubled from a year ago to&nbsp;$26.5&nbsp;billion across approximately 1.8 million funded accounts. To date, customers have received over&nbsp;$500 million&nbsp;in matches on retirement account transfers and contributions. Robinhood Strategies expanded its reach to over 200 thousand Funded Customers and&nbsp;$1.3 billion&nbsp;in assets under management. Robinhood Banking also recently started rolling out to Robinhood Gold Subscribers, with over 20 thousand customers depositing approximately&nbsp;$300 million&nbsp;as of&nbsp;January 31, 2026.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>#1 Global Financial Ecosystem&nbsp;</strong>- Robinhood extended its push for global financial innovation with continued expansion into new markets and new international products. Robinhood strengthened its offering in the&nbsp;UK&nbsp;by launching a stocks and shares ISA, the most requested feature from&nbsp;UK&nbsp;customers, supporting long-term, tax-advantaged investing. Bitstamp institutional volumes continue to scale, more than doubling since the close of the acquisition in&nbsp;June 2025, and in&nbsp;Europe, Robinhood quadrupled its Stock Tokens offering to approximately 2,000. During the fourth quarter, Robinhood also announced agreements to acquire a brokerage and crypto firm in&nbsp;Indonesia, expanding its reach in&nbsp;Asia.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Conference Call and Livestream Information</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Robinhood will host a video call to discuss its results at&nbsp;2 p.m. PT&nbsp;/&nbsp;5 p.m. ET&nbsp;today,&nbsp;February&nbsp;10, 2026. The video call can be accessed at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>, along with the earnings press release and accompanying slide presentation. The event will also be live streamed to YouTube and&nbsp;<a href="http://x.com/">X.com</a>&nbsp;via Robinhood&rsquo;s official channels, @RobinhoodApp, on Vlad Tenev&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="http://x.com/">X.com</a>&nbsp;account, @vladtenev, as well as in the Robinhood App. Following the call, a replay and transcript will also be available at&nbsp;<a href="http://investors.robinhood.com/">investors.robinhood.com</a>.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Financial Outlook</strong></p>
<p align="justify">The paragraph below provides information on our 2026 expense plan and outlook. We are not providing a 2026 outlook for total operating expenses and have not reconciled our 2026 outlook for Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, total operating expenses, because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the impact of certain items without unreasonable effort. These items include, but are not limited to, provision for credit losses and significant regulatory expenses which may be material and could have a significant impact on total operating expenses for 2026.</p>
<p align="justify">Our 2026 expense plan is designed to accelerate product velocity, drive Net Deposit growth, and grow revenues. This expense outlook includes growth investments in new or recently launched products and features, marketing, international expansion, full year costs related to the 2025 acquisitions of TradePMR and Bitstamp, and rapid growth in existing core products; while also driving rapid growth in existing core products and productivity and efficiency gains in our existing businesses. Our outlook for 2026 Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is&nbsp;$2.6 billion&nbsp;to&nbsp;$2.725 billion, which represents 18% year-over-year growth at the midpoint relative to 2025 Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This expense outlook does not include provision for credit losses, costs related to our pending acquisitions, costs related to the Rothera joint venture, costs from modifications of executive awards in connection with our CFO transition, potential significant regulatory matters, or other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and other business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that may arise or accruals we may determine in the future are required, as we are unable to accurately predict the size or timing of such matters, expenses or accruals at this time.</p>
<p align="justify">Actual results might differ materially from our outlook due to several factors, including the rate of growth in Funded Customers and our effectiveness to cross-sell products which affects variable marketing costs, the degree to which we are successful in managing credit losses and preventing fraud, and our ability to manage web-hosting expenses efficiently, among other factors. See &ldquo;Non-GAAP Financial Measures&rdquo; for more information on Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC, including significant items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses that would be adjusted out of total operating expenses (GAAP) to get to Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC (non-GAAP) should they occur.</p>

<p align="justify"><strong>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</strong></p>
<p align="justify">This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected financial performance of&nbsp;Robinhood Markets, Inc.&nbsp;and its consolidated subsidiaries (&ldquo;we,&rdquo; &ldquo;Robinhood,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) and our strategic and operational plans, including (among others) statements regarding that we are building the Financial SuperApp; that we are incredibly excited about our plan and momentum for the year ahead, as we focus on shipping great products for customers and driving profitable growth for shareholders; and all statements and information under the heading &ldquo;Financial Outlook&rdquo;. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as &ldquo;believe,&rdquo; &ldquo;may,&rdquo; &ldquo;will,&rdquo; &ldquo;should,&rdquo; &ldquo;expect,&rdquo; &ldquo;plan,&rdquo; &ldquo;anticipate,&rdquo; &ldquo;could,&rdquo; &ldquo;intend,&rdquo; &ldquo;target,&rdquo; &ldquo;project,&rdquo; &ldquo;contemplate,&rdquo; &ldquo;estimate,&rdquo; &ldquo;predict,&rdquo; &ldquo;potential,&rdquo; or &ldquo;continue,&rdquo; or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Our forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors that may cause our actual future results, performance, or achievements to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied in this press release. Reported results should not be considered an indication of future performance. Factors that contribute to the uncertain nature of our forward-looking statements include, among others: our rapid and continuing expansion, including continuing to introduce new products and services on our platforms as well as geographic expansion; the difficulty of managing our business effectively, including the size of our workforce, and the risk of declining or negative growth; the fluctuations in our financial results and key metrics from quarter to quarter; our reliance on transaction-based revenue, including payment for order flow (&ldquo;PFOF&rdquo;), the risk of new regulation or bans on PFOF and similar practices, and the addition of our new fee-based model for cryptocurrency; our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and rapidly changing interest rate environments; the difficulty of raising additional capital (to provide liquidity needs and support business growth and objectives) on reasonable terms, if at all; the need to maintain capital levels required by regulators and self-regulatory organizations ("SROs"); the risk that we might mishandle the cash, securities, and cryptocurrencies we hold on behalf of customers, and our exposure to liability for processing, operational, or technical errors in clearing functions; the impact of negative publicity on our brand and reputation; the risk that changes in business, economic, or political conditions that impact the global financial markets, or a systemic market event, might harm our business; our dependence on key employees and a skilled workforce; the fact that we do not wholly own or operationally control Rothera, our joint venture with&nbsp;Susquehanna International Group, and its subsidiaries; operational and regulatory risks and expenditures prior to and following closing of our acquisitions and investments; the difficulty of complying with an extensive, complex, and changing regulatory environment, the risk of monetary and other penalties for noncompliance, and the need to adjust our business model in response to new or modified laws and regulations; the possibility of adverse developments in pending litigation and regulatory investigations; the risk that the outcome of currently ongoing and potential future regulatory enforcement actions and litigation, as well as potential changes in federal or state law, could immediately or subsequently prevent us from offering, or continuing to offer, event contracts; the effects of competition; our need to innovate and acquire or invest in new products, services, technologies and geographies in order to attract and retain customers and deepen their engagement with us in order to maintain growth; our reliance on third parties to perform some key functions and the risk that processing, operational or technological failures could impair the availability or stability of our platforms; the risk of cybersecurity incidents, theft, data breaches, and other online attacks; the difficulty of processing customer data in compliance with privacy laws; our need as a regulated financial services company to develop and maintain effective compliance and risk management infrastructures; the risks associated with incorporating artificial intelligence ("AI") technologies into some of our products and processes; the regulation, litigation, contractual, operational, and reputational risks associated with our introduction of products such as Robinhood Stock Tokens in the European Economic Area (the "EEA") and our staking services offered in the&nbsp;U.S.; and the risk that substantial future sales of Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that they may occur, could cause the price of our stock to fall. Because some of these risks and uncertainties cannot be predicted or quantified and some are beyond our control, you should not rely on our forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our business and financial results can be found in Part II, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended&nbsp;September 30, 2025, as well as in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;), all of which are available on the SEC&rsquo;s web site at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sec.gov/">www.sec.gov</a>. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment; new risks and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks nor identify all uncertainties. The events and circumstances reflected in our forward-looking statements might not be achieved and actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Except as otherwise noted, all forward-looking statements in this press release are made as of the date of this press release,&nbsp;February 10, 2026, and are based on information and estimates available to us at this time. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Except as required by law, Robinhood assumes no obligation to update any of the statements in this press release whether as a result of any new information, future events, changed circumstances, or otherwise. You should read this press release with the understanding that our actual future results, performance, events, and circumstances might be materially different from what we expect. All fourth quarter and full year 2025 financial information in this press release is preliminary, based on our estimates and subject to completion of our financial closing procedures. Final results for the full year, which will be reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended&nbsp;December 31, 2025, may vary from the information in this press release. In particular, until our financial statements are issued in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, we may be required to recognize certain subsequent events (such as in connection with contingencies or the realization of assets) which could affect our final results.</p>
<p align="justify">The Select Preliminary&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;Operating Data in this press release is unaudited and preliminary, based on Robinhood&rsquo;s estimates, and subject to completion of financial closing procedures. Final operating data for&nbsp;January 2026&nbsp;and results for the first quarter of 2026, as reported in our upcoming monthly metrics release and in Robinhood&rsquo;s quarterly and annual filings with the&nbsp;SEC, respectively, might vary from the information in this press release.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Non-GAAP Financial Measures</strong></p>
<p align="justify">We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business, allocate our resources and assess our performance. In addition to total net revenues, net income, and other results under GAAP, we utilize non-GAAP calculations of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (&ldquo;Adjusted EBITDA&rdquo;), Adjusted EBITDA Margin, Adjusted Operating Expenses, and Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC. This non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, and may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We believe each of these non-GAAP measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations, as well as providing a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business performance and cost structure, as applicable. These non-GAAP measures are used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables included in this press release.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income, excluding (i) interest expenses related to credit facilities, (ii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (iii) depreciation and amortization, (iv) SBC, (v) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (vi) other significant gains, losses, and expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing results.</p>
<p align="justify">The above items are excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA measure because these items are non-cash in nature, or because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measurement used by our management internally to make operating decisions, including those related to operating expenses, evaluate performance, and perform strategic planning and annual budgeting.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted EBITDA Margin</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by total net revenues. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is net margin (calculated as net income divided by total net revenues).</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) SBC, (ii) provision for credit losses, (iii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iv) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses) that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Starting in Q1 2025, Adjusted Operating Expenses no longer includes provision for credit losses.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC</em></p>
<p align="justify">Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC is defined as GAAP total operating expenses minus (i) provision for credit losses, (ii) significant legal and tax settlements and reserves, and (iii) other significant expenses (such as impairments, restructuring charges, and business acquisition- or disposition-related expenses), that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing expenses. The amount and timing of the excluded items are unpredictable, are not driven by core results of operations, and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful. Unlike Adjusted Operating Expenses, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC does not adjust for SBC except for in 2026 as it relates to modification of executive awards related to our CFO transition. Starting in Q1 2025, Adjusted Operating Expenses and SBC no longer includes provision for credit losses.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Q4 2024 Tax Benefit and Regulatory Accrual Reversal</em></p>
<p align="justify">In Q4 2024, the Company recorded a&nbsp;$369 million&nbsp;deferred tax benefit ($0.41&nbsp;of diluted EPS), primarily from the release of the Company's valuation allowance on most of its net deferred tax assets, as well as a&nbsp;$55 million&nbsp;benefit ($0.06&nbsp;of diluted EPS) due to a reversal of an accrual as part of a regulatory settlement. Together, these items represented a&nbsp;$424 million&nbsp;benefit ($0.47&nbsp;of diluted EPS) in Q4 2024.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Key Performance Metrics</strong></p>
<p align="justify">In addition to the measures presented in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key performance metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Funded Customers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Funded Customer as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and, within the past 45 calendar days (a) had an account balance that was greater than zero (excluding amounts that are deposited into a Funded Customer account by the Company with no action taken by the unique person) or (b) completed a transaction using any such account. Individuals who share a funded joint investing account (which launched in&nbsp;July 2024) are each considered to be a Funded Customer. Starting in Q1 2025, individuals who are customers of Registered Investment Advisors ("RIAs") that use the TradePMR platform, and, starting in&nbsp;June 2025, customers of Bitstamp, are also considered Funded Customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Total Platform Assets</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Total Platform Assets as the sum of the fair value of all equities, options, cryptocurrency, futures (including options on futures and swaps, including event contracts), cash held by users in their accounts, net of receivables from users (previously reported as Assets Under Custody), and any such assets managed by RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform that are not custodied by Robinhood, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis. Net Deposits and net market gains (losses) drive the change in Total Platform Assets in any given period. Starting in&nbsp;June 2025, the fair value of all cryptocurrency includes cryptocurrency on Bitstamp.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Assets Under Custody</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Assets Under Custody as Total Platform Assets, excluding assets managed by RIAs using TradePMR's platform that are not custodied by Robinhood, as of a stated date or period end on a trade date basis.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Net Deposits as all cash deposits and asset transfers from customers, as well as dividends, interest, staking rewards, and cash or assets earned in connection with Company promotions (such as account transfer and retirement match incentives, free stock bonuses) received by customers, net of reversals, customer cash withdrawals, margin and lending interest, Robinhood Gold subscription fees, and assets transferred off of our platforms for a stated period. Starting in&nbsp;June 2025, Net Deposits include results from Bitstamp. Due to data limitations, we have not included TradePMR client figures in our Net Deposits key performance metric.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Average Revenue Per User (&ldquo;ARPU&rdquo;)</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define ARPU as total revenue for a given period divided by the average number of Funded Customers on the last day of that period and the last day of the immediately preceding period. Figures in this press release represent ARPU annualized for each three-month period presented.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Gold Subscribers</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define a Robinhood Gold Subscriber as a unique person who has at least one account with a Robinhood entity and who, as of the end of the relevant period (a) is subscribed to Robinhood Gold and (b) has made at least one Robinhood Gold subscription fee payment.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Additional Operating Metrics</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Retirement AUC</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Robinhood Retirement AUC as the total Assets Under Custody in traditional individual retirement accounts (&ldquo;IRAs") and&nbsp;
Roth IRAs. This does not include accounts with an RIA using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Cash Sweep</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Cash Sweep as the period-end total amount of participating users&rsquo; uninvested brokerage and banking cash that has been automatically &ldquo;swept&rdquo; or moved from their accounts into deposits for their benefit at a network of program banks. This is an off-balance-sheet amount. Robinhood earns a net interest spread on Cash Sweep balances based on the interest rate offered by the banks less the interest rate given to users as stated in our program terms. This includes balances from customers of RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Margin Book</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Margin Book as our period-end aggregate outstanding margin loan balances receivable (i.e., the period-end total amount we are owed by customers on loans made for the purchase of securities, supported by a pledge of assets in their margin-enabled brokerage accounts). This includes margin loan balances from customers of RIAs using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Notional Trading Volume</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Notional Trading Volume, or Notional Volume, for any specified asset class as the aggregate dollar value (purchase price or sale price as applicable) of trades executed in that asset class on our platforms over a specified period of time. Crypto Notional Volume includes both Robinhood App Notional Volume and, starting in&nbsp;June 2025, Bitstamp Notional Volume. Robinhood App Notional Volume represents the dollar value of executed crypto trades on the Robinhood platform over a specified period of time. Bitstamp Notional Volume represents the dollar value of executed crypto trades on the Bitstamp platform over a specified period of time. For example, each&nbsp;$1&nbsp;of transaction value executed between a buyer and seller is counted as&nbsp;$1&nbsp;of transaction value in the relevant period, rather than&nbsp;$2&nbsp;if counted for each of the buyer and seller.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Options Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Options Contracts Traded as the total number of options contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time. Each contract generally entitles the holder to trade 100 shares of the underlying stock.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Event Contracts Traded</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define Event Contracts Traded as the total number of event contracts bought or sold over a specified period of time through our Prediction Markets Hub. Each contract can be traded at&nbsp;$0.01&nbsp;increments up to&nbsp;$1&nbsp;and is worth&nbsp;$1&nbsp;upon settlement.</p>
<p align="justify"><strong>Glossary Terms</strong></p>
<p align="justify"><em>Investment Accounts</em><br /><br />We define an Investment Account as a funded individual brokerage account, a funded joint investing account, a funded IRA, or an account with an RIA using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform. Starting in&nbsp;September 2025, a Funded Customer can have multiple Investment Accounts - one or more individual brokerage accounts, a joint investing account, a traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, and/or an RIA custody account using TradePMR&rsquo;s platform. Investment Accounts do not include Bitstamp as such accounts are not brokerage or other Investment Accounts.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Robinhood Gold Adoption Rate</em></p>
<p align="justify">We define the Robinhood Gold adoption rate as end of period Robinhood Gold Subscribers divided by end of period Funded Customers.</p>
<p align="justify"><em>Growth Rate and Annualized Growth Rate with respect to Net Deposits</em></p>
<p align="justify">Growth rate is calculated as aggregate Net Deposits over a specified 12-month period, divided by Total Platform Assets for the fiscal quarter that immediately precedes such 12-month period. Annualized growth rate is calculated as Net Deposits for a specified quarter multiplied by 4 and divided by Total Platform Assets for the immediately preceding quarter.</p>

<title>SIFMA Statement On The Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act Of 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SIFMA today issued the following statement from president and CEO Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr. on H.R. 3682, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025, which will be considered on the House floor later today:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SIFMA supports passage of H.R. 3682, the Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of 2025, sponsored by Rep. Bill Foster (D-IL) and Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-MI). Congress charged the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) with identifying and addressing risks to U.S. financial stability, but over time the Council&rsquo;s varying approaches to designating nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) have created uncertainty in the markets. H.R. 3682 would provide needed clarity and consistency by establishing clear statutory guardrails for FSOC&rsquo;s process and ensuring that SIFI designations are used only as a last resort. SIFMA urges Congress to advance this bipartisan legislation to promote stability and predictability in FSOC&rsquo;s oversight of nonbank financial companies.&rdquo;</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Maintaining Focus On Basel III Endgame Recalibration</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-maintaining-focus-on-basel-iii-endgame-recalibration-2026210/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-maintaining-focus-on-basel-iii-endgame-recalibration-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In its original form, the US Basel III endgame proposal would have resulted in disproportionate increases in capital for trading book activities, forcing banks to make difficult choices about their participation in certain businesses. After two-and-a-half years, a revised proposal is expected to be published soon, paving the way towards finalization and implementation of the rules. At ISDA, we&rsquo;ve advocated relentlessly for calibration changes to achieve a robust, more risk-sensitive framework, and we hope this will be a turning point effectively balances the need for safety and soundness with market vibrancy.</p>
<p>ISDA&rsquo;s commitment to risk-appropriate capital rules isn&rsquo;t confined to the US &ndash; it&rsquo;s critical in every jurisdiction around the world. If capital requirements are disproportionate to the underlying risk, companies and governments that rely on banks for financing would face reduced support, as well as a lack of hedging solutions and increased vulnerability to external shocks. In turn, this would undermine economic growth and stability &ndash; outcomes we can&rsquo;t afford to risk. To avoid this happening in the US, changes need to be made in certain key areas.</p>
<p>First, we need to ensure internal models have a viable future for the calculation of market risk capital. While the Basel III market risk framework &ndash; the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) &ndash; deliberately raises the bar for the use of internal models, the proposed rules are so complex and operationally challenging that they threaten to choke off the use of internal models altogether. This would be a major change that we don&rsquo;t think is in line with the Basel Committee&rsquo;s intentions. We&rsquo;ve proposed certain adjustments, including reducing the stringency of the profit-and-loss attribution test and addressing long-standing issues in the treatment of non-modellable risk factors, which would ensure the continued viability of internal models under the FRTB.</p>
<p>Second, we believe the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk should be amended to recognize the risk-reducing benefits of netting across products, including repos and futures. With mandatory clearing of certain cash US Treasury securities set to begin at the end of this year, and repos following in the middle of next year, the lack of recognition of cross-product netting would constrain banks&rsquo; balance sheets and limit their ability to offer client clearing. This issue must be addressed to enable the smooth implementation of the Treasury clearing rule.</p>
<p>Third, the combined effect of the proposed Basel III endgame and the capital surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) would increase capital for US G-SIB client clearing businesses by more than 80%. That&rsquo;s completely at odds with the policy objective to promote and incentivize clearing and would negatively affect market stability. By including the client-facing leg of a cleared derivatives transaction in the Basel III credit valuation adjustment framework and adjusting the G-SIB surcharge, policymakers can reduce this disproportionate tax on clearing.</p>
<p>These are just three of the important issues we&rsquo;ve been focusing on as US policymakers have weighed up industry feedback and redrafted the original endgame proposal. Once the revisions are published, focus will shift to finalization and implementation of the rules. We&rsquo;ll test the recalibrated framework to make sure it delivers the risk sensitivity that is so crucial. We&rsquo;ll then work with our members to address any challenges on the road to implementation and pursue the end result that is needed &ndash; a robust, risk-sensitive trading book capital framework that stands the test of time.</p>

<p>The Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX), a wholly owned subsidiary of Miami International Holding, Inc. (NYSE: MIAX), today reported its 2025 year-end results, highlighting a record year for insurance-linked securities (ILS) listings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>BSX reported 209 new ILS listings in 2025, a 34.0% increase from 2024, bringing its total number of listings to 746 and accounting for 93.2% of global ILS issuances in 2025. The growth reflects the depth and resilience of Bermuda's regulatory framework and BSX&rsquo;s deliberate commercial strategy designed to support sophisticated risk-transfer products.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2025, BSX continued to attract catastrophe bond listings from global issuers covering climate-related risks across Europe, Asia and the Americas while also listing new cyber catastrophe bonds, reflecting the growing importance of this emerging asset class. Together, these vehicles enable the global insurance and reinsurance industry to deploy capital efficiently, innovate responsibly, and address the challenge of narrowing the world's insurance protection gap.</p>
<p>2025 also marked a major technology advancement for BSX with the March launch of a new, state-of-theart trading, clearing, settlement, and depository platform built on MIAX&rsquo;s proprietary technology. The fullyintegrated system enables BSX to respond to evolving market demand, expand the range of products it can offer customers, and align with MIAX&rsquo;s strategy to operate all its exchanges on its proprietary technology.</p>
<p>"BSX has led the way in listing ILS vehicles for more than a decade, and we are proud to have not only maintained but strengthened our leadership position in 2025," said Greg Wojciechowski, President and Chief Executive Officer of BSX. "Our strong results and technology launch in 2025 demonstrate our capacity to innovate while supporting global reinsurance needs. Our ongoing success is driven by well-established expertise in securities listings paired with an efficient listing process, all within a jurisdiction engineered for insurance innovation."&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) today announced the launch of the Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes, a new suite of benchmarks designed to deliver transparency, representativeness, and robustness to private markets. Built to help institutional investors and consultants benchmark performance, analyze exposures, and navigate private capital markets with precision, the indexes introduce rules‑based rigor and consistent measurement to segments that have historically lacked reliable, objective standards.</p>
<p>The launch of the index suite marks the next phase in the evolution of Nasdaq Private Capital Solutions, designed to deliver transparent benchmarking, institutional‑quality data, and robust analytics to help investors navigate an increasingly complex private markets landscape. Drawing on decades of private market expertise, the solutions‑based platform unifies Nasdaq Private Capital Indexes, Nasdaq eVestment Fund and Deal Benchmarking, the Nasdaq eVestment Private Fund Universe and the Nasdaq eVestment TopQ+ Analytics platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Private markets are at a pivotal moment, growing rapidly in both importance and complexity. Yet the ecosystem remains highly fragmented, with data trapped in silos, inconsistent benchmarks, and limited interoperability,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span class="xn-person">Oliver Albers</span>, Executive Vice President and Chief Product Officer, Capital Access Platforms at Nasdaq. &ldquo;The Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes change that. Built on LP‑reported fund performance, they give institutions a comprehensive and representative view of private markets. By combining this trusted data foundation with transparent methodologies and workflow‑ready tools, we&rsquo;re providing the clarity and connectivity investors need to navigate private markets with confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Constructed from more than 14,000 institutional private market funds that represent over&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$11.4 trillion</span>&nbsp;in global AUM sourced from Nasdaq eVestment&rsquo;s LP reported dataset, the Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes are designed to deliver robust and transparent coverage. The indexes employ a documented, rules‑based methodology featuring Modified Dietz quarterly performance measurement, NAV‑weighted aggregation, and a standardized two‑quarter restatement process designed to align with institutional governance expectations. The suite spans aggregate private capital as well as private equity, buyout, venture capital, private debt, fund of funds and real estate strategies.</p>
<p>Delivered through Nasdaq eVestment TopQ+, a leading private markets fund research and performance analytics platform, Nasdaq Global Index Watch (GIW), and Nasdaq&rsquo;s broader data licensing channels, Nasdaq Private Capital&trade; Indexes aim to provide objective rules-based benchmarks that can better inform asset allocation and comparative performance, enhance risk and return reporting capabilities, and ease data management and system integration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As allocations to private markets grow, institutions increasingly expect greater transparency, data, and stronger operational infrastructure to support their investment processes,&rdquo; added Albers. &ldquo;Private Capital Solutions reflects Nasdaq&rsquo;s long‑term commitment to helping build that foundation, giving institutions the tools they need to make better decisions today while preparing the industry for what comes next.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="dbx-richtext">
<div>
<p class="p--heading-1">Ahead of Eurex's Derivatives Forum in Frankfurt, taking place on 25 and 26 February, we spoke to Ladi Williams, Head of Thematics and Alternative Strategies Product Management at STOXX, to discuss the latest trends in thematic indexes and the future shape of innovation.</p>
</div>

<div class="dbx-container dbx-richtext">
<div class="dbx-row">
<div class="dbx-col-sm-12 dbx-col-md-12 dbx-col-xl-10">
<div>
<p class="p--heading-3">As an index provider, how do you approach index construction for a task as broad and far-reaching as thematic indexes?</p>
<p><strong>Ladi Williams:</strong>&nbsp;Our STOXX thematic framework allows us to capture themes in a systematic and transparent way. Our approach recognizes four different phases in how a theme permeates through society and is based on the diffusion of innovation theory. Those comprise ideation, innovation, commercialization and maturity.</p>
<p>The various themes that we cover can be at different stages of progress. That means we adapt the data set or group of indicators we use to effectively capture companies in the index.</p>
<p>In the ideation stage, companies are mainly talking about their technology. They haven't actually started any significant product development. When they move away from the ideation stage to the innovation stage is when we might see activity such as intellectual property creation. This is when companies start filing patents and we really begin to see some significant progress.</p>
<p>Once those patterns are being used in the R&amp;D stage, it translates into products and services that you can commercialize. That's when you start to see these companies generate revenues and become well established &ndash; demonstrating the sort of trends which can be traditionally captured through sector investing.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Once a theme grows to become significant to the broader economy, how do you capture its nuances?</p>
<p>You can address themes by looking at different parts of the value chain. AI is a good example. There are different areas in the AI value chain, and we target those with different indexes. For some other themes though, it might make sense to only launch one index.</p>
<p>As well as the method of targeting multiple sub-themes and launching an index family from those, we are seeing greater specialization in the index itself. Over the years, thematic indices have shifted away from having 150-plus constituents to being more targeted in their exposure. We are seeing a lot of demand for those more specialized indexes from our end clients.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Given the level of awareness of some of these themes, such as AI, how do you differentiate your product against other index providers?</p>
<p>At STOXX, we prioritize a collaborative approach and don't work in a silo. That means engaging with clients throughout the process and taking their feedback on board continuously.</p>
<p>There are then many ways in which you can differentiate on product. As an index provider you must decide whether to focus on a specific segment of the market, or to look across the whole supply and value chain.</p>
<p>The way that we look at AI, for instance, is that you have the &lsquo;picks and shovels&rsquo; companies that are responsible for building the required infrastructure. Then, on the other side of the value chain, you have companies that are leveraging AI technology or pursuing value integration. They are AI adopters and could include companies that are using AI in healthcare, finance or mobility. We have AI indexes that target those two different areas. We also use a complementary approach, which looks at both.</p>
<p>For the theme of defense, we can distinguish on a regional basis. For example, designing a global defense product or a European one, which was a very popular theme in 2025. Drilling further down, differentiation can be achieved by screens, weighting approaches right down to security level caps and counts.</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">How do you see client demand for these products evolving in the coming years?</p>
<p>We see thematic indexes being used by a variety of client segments. You have ETF issuers that will use thematic indexes as the investment strategy for their fund. We also work with sell-side institutions that take thematic indexes and wrap them into structured products that have different types of payoffs and where they can embed some principal protection.</p>
<p>That shows the level of variation on the product side. Beyond special screens and overlays, and flexible methodologies, a big part of customization and how you differentiate as a provider is data.</p>
<p>AI is going to start opening a lot of doors and allow us to create and scale more data sets that we will be able to incorporate into rules-based, systematic and transparent indexes. Only a few years ago, if you wanted to use earnings calls transcripts, or text from company websites or filings, it was very difficult to do that manually.</p>
<p>Now, AI tools can scrape these various data points and create data sets from this information. We can then embed those in index strategies. It allows you to push the envelope for what was previously the remit of an active equity analyst doing a lot of research. That is an area where we are going to be seeing a lot more innovation.</p>
<p class="p--heading-1"><br />Visit the panel at Derivatives Forum Frankfurt on 25 February from 15:05-15:50 CET</p>
<p class="p--heading-3">Europe's Defense, AI &amp; Quantum Computing &ndash; Forces Shaping Markets</p>
<p>This session explores three of 2025's most influential thematic trends: European defense, artificial intelligence (AI), and the emerging role of quantum computing. Defense spending and AI have already delivered exceptional performance, driven by structural shifts and transformative innovation. Quantum computing, while still early-stage, is increasingly seen as a strategic enabler &ndash;&nbsp;without requiring a complete overhaul of existing systems. The discussion shall highlight strategies, valuation frameworks, and long-term growth drivers for these themes.</p>

<p>HM Treasury hosted representatives from U.S. Treasury and regulatory agencies in London on January 26, 2026, to conduct joint senior-level industry engagement for the Transatlantic Taskforce for Markets of the Future established last September.  The discussions explored opportunities to improve links between our capital markets and to collaborate on digital assets.</p>
<p>This engagement is part of the Taskforce&rsquo;s efforts to seek input from industry partners to ensure that its work is informed by what matters most to industry on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>We thank all participants for the dynamic discussions and insights.</p>
<p>In September 2025, as part of President Trump&rsquo;s state visit to the UK, Secretary of the Treasury, Scott Bessent, and Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves, established the Taskforce to enhance the deep and historic connection between the world&rsquo;s leading financial hubs in the UK and the United States.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury and HM Treasury will continue to work closely together with additional joint engagements in the United States anticipated this month. The Taskforce aims to report back to both finance ministries on its recommendations via the UK-U.S. Financial Regulatory Working Group in summer 2026.</p>

<p align="left"><span>Use of&nbsp;</span><span>Non-GAAP</span><span>&nbsp;Financial Measures</span></p>
<p align="left">In this news release, the company supplements its reporting of information determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;), such as revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities, with &ldquo;adjusted revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue,&rdquo; &ldquo;organic revenue growth,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted operating margin,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted net income,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share,&rdquo; &ldquo;adjusted earnings per share change,&rdquo; and &ldquo;free cash flow.&rdquo; Management believes that adjustments for certain non-cash or other items and the exclusion of certain pass-through revenue and expenses should enhance shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate the company&rsquo;s performance, as such measures provide additional insights into the factors and trends affecting its business. Therefore, the company excludes these items from its GAAP financial measures to calculate these unaudited non-GAAP measures. The corresponding reconciliations of these unaudited non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are included in this news release, except for forward-looking measures where a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available due to the variability, complexity, and limited visibility of the non-cash and other items described below that are excluded from the non-GAAP outlook measures. See page 15 for additional information regarding the company&rsquo;s forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.</p>
<p align="left">Examples of non-cash or other items may include, but are not limited to, non-cash intangible asset amortization expense associated with acquisitions; non-cash impairment and terminated pension plan settlement charges; merger and integration costs; severance costs; certain transformation related expenses associated with the company&rsquo;s One Fiserv action plan; gains or losses from the sale of businesses, certain assets or investments; and certain discrete tax benefits and expenses. The company excludes these items to more clearly focus on the factors management believes are pertinent to the company&rsquo;s operations, and management uses this information to make operating decisions, including the allocation of resources to the company&rsquo;s various businesses.</p>
<p align="left">The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation.</p>
<p align="left">Management believes organic revenue growth is useful because it presents revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions, dispositions and the impact of the company&rsquo;s postage reimbursements. Management believes free cash flow is useful to measure the funds generated in a given period that are available for debt service requirements and strategic capital decisions. Management believes this supplemental information enhances shareholders&rsquo; ability to evaluate and understand the company&rsquo;s core business performance.</p>
<p align="left">These unaudited non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, revenue, operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Fiserv, diluted earnings per share and net cash provided by operating activities or any other amount determined in accordance with GAAP.</p>

<ol>
<li>Represents acquisition and related integration costs incurred in connection with acquisitions. Merger and integration costs associated with integration activities in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 include $9 million and $21 million of third-party professional service fees, respectively, as well as $25 million related to legal and other settlements for the full year 2025. Merger and integration costs associated with integration activities for the full year 2024 primarily include $23 million of third-party professional service fees, $22 million of share-based compensation, and $14 million related to a legal settlement.</li>
<li>Represents third-party consulting and professional service fees associated with a multi-year transformation initiative focused on operational excellence enabled by artificial intelligence, including process reengineering and technology infrastructure modernization.</li>
<li>Represents amortization of intangible assets acquired through acquisition, including customer relationships, software/technology and trade names. This adjustment does not exclude the amortization of other intangible assets such as contract costs (sales commissions and deferred conversion costs), capitalized and purchased software, financing costs and debt discounts. See additional information on page 14 for an analysis of the company&rsquo;s amortization expense.</li>
<li>Represents the company&rsquo;s share of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets at its unconsolidated affiliates, as well as the minority interest share of amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets at its subsidiaries in which the company holds a controlling financial interest. This adjustment in the fourth quarter and full year 2025 also includes a $51 million gain related to the sale of an equity method investment, recorded within income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>Represents a non-cash impairment of certain equity method investments during 2024, primarily related to the company&rsquo;s Wells Fargo Merchant Services joint venture, recorded within income (loss) from investments in unconsolidated affiliates in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>Represents a non-cash settlement charge associated with the terminations of the company&rsquo;s defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom and United States. Settlements of the terminated plans were completed in the fourth quarter of 2024.</li>
<li>Represents a gain associated with the sale of an equity security in the fourth quarter of 2025, recorded within other expense, net in the consolidated statements of income.</li>
<li>The tax impact of adjustments is calculated using a tax rate of 19.5% and 20% for the full year 2025 and 2024, respectively, which approximates the company&rsquo;s annual effective tax rate, exclusive of actual tax impacts of an aggregate $30 million provision associated with the gain on certain investments during 2025 and an aggregate $196 million benefit associated with the impairment of certain equity method investments and the settlement charge for terminated pension plans during 2024.</li>
<li>Represents incremental compensation expense associated with the transition of the company&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer (&ldquo;CEO&rdquo;), comprised of $40 million of former CEO non-cash share-based compensation and related employer payroll taxes, and a $12 million cash replacement award paid to the company&rsquo;s new CEO appointed in 2025.</li>
<li>The Argentine government announced economic policy changes, including the removal of certain currency controls, resulting in a significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso on April 14, 2025. This adjustment represents the corresponding one-day foreign currency exchange loss from the remeasurement of the company&rsquo;s Argentina subsidiary&rsquo;s monetary assets and liabilities in Argentina&rsquo;s highly inflationary economy.</li>

<ol>
<li>The company adjusts its non-GAAP results to exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Management believes that the adjustment of acquisition-related intangible asset amortization supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the comparability of operating performance. Although the company excludes amortization from acquisition-related intangible assets from its non-GAAP expenses, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.</li>

<title>Energy Exchange ElectronX Launches First Direct-Access U.S. Power Derivatives For Intraday Volatility - Energy Exchange ElectronX Launches First Direct-Access U.S. Power Derivatives For Intraday Volatility</title>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4613052-1&amp;h=2522133493&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Felectronx.com%2F&amp;a=ElectronX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ElectronX</a></span>, the energy exchange built to enable precision risk management in electricity markets, today announced it has launched its first product suite of U.S.-regulated power contracts designed for trading and managing intraday price volatility.</p>
<p>Hourly bounded futures and binary options for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market are now available in 1 MWh sizes on ElectronX's direct-access platform, enabling new financial hedging strategies to limit losses and control costs in times of short-term price stress.</p>
<p>ElectronX's fully collateralized and small-sized contracts&mdash;cash-settled in near real-time through its regulated clearinghouse&mdash;are the first derivatives tailored for the specific risk transfer and price discovery profiles of distributed energy resources, large load consumers, and energy sector innovators in the rapidly evolving U.S. electricity ecosystem.</p>
<p>"In recent years, volatility in intraday power prices has sharply increased in an environment of growing power demand, intermittent renewable energy generation, and adverse weather, including extreme temperature events," said Sam Tegel, CEO of ElectronX. "An outdated financial market dynamic of fractured and shallow short-term liquidity has exacerbated this phenomenon, leading to a severely underhedged power sector when compared with other mature commodities markets.</p>
<p>"Marketplace solutions must include broader access to derivatives for an increasingly&nbsp;<span>decentralized</span>&nbsp;industry with newer business models and innovative technologies&mdash;and our direct-access platform, small-sized contracts, and lower capital requirements are designed for these participants looking to hedge risk specific to their varied physical assets," continued Tegel. "By expanding participation and deepening liquidity in power hedging overall, ElectronX can help usher in an era of improved efficiency, reliability and cost optimization for all U.S. electricity markets."</p>
<p>After&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://edge.prnewswire.com/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=4613052-1&amp;h=887138357&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prnewswire.com%2Fnews-releases%2Fenergy-exchange-electronx-earns-cftc-designated-market-and-clearing-approvals-302542250.html&amp;a=earning+exchange+and+clearinghouse+regulatory+approvals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earning exchange and clearinghouse regulatory approvals</a></span>&nbsp;from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in August 2025, ElectronX opened in a limited soft launch capacity in December, listing select ERCOT North Hub contracts for a group of early adopter participants. The ERCOT suite in its entirety launched last week. Five ERCOT hubs and two hub averages are tradeable for the 120 hours following the current hour. Each contract represents the real-time market value of 1 MWh of power for a specific hub and hourly period, allowing traders to observe, capture and trade precise views on forecasted weather, power demand, and curtailment risks.</p>
<p>ElectronX's market structure, trading interface, and product design were developed with valuable input from leaders and innovators in the U.S. power industry. Exchange members of ElectronX include:</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE:ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced that the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) has granted recognition to ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (IBA) as a third-country benchmark administrator under Article 32 of the EU Benchmarks Regulation (EU BMR).</p>
<p>ESMA&rsquo;s recognition decision means that IBA&rsquo;s &lsquo;significant&rsquo; EU benchmarks &ndash; the ICE Swap Rate&reg; and the LBMA Gold Price &ndash; remain available for use by &lsquo;supervised entities&rsquo; in the European Union under the EU BMR.</p>
<p>&ldquo;IBA is pleased to have been granted recognition by ESMA,&rdquo; said Clive de Ruig, President of ICE Benchmark Administration. &ldquo;This decision ensures IBA&rsquo;s EU-based clients can continue to use the ICE Swap Rate&reg; and the LBMA Gold Price without disruption and demonstrates our ability to apply robust governance and best-in-class technology to give market participants confidence in the information they depend upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to being recognised by ESMA, ICE Benchmark Administration is authorised and regulated by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority for the regulated activity of administering a benchmark. ICE Benchmark Administration administers a number of other benchmarks pursuant to this authorisation, including the LBMA Silver Price, the ICE Term Reference Rates, and the ICE RFR Indexes. These benchmarks are not currently in scope of the EU BMR and, accordingly, are not currently subject to any EU-usage restrictions.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Takes Action Against HTX To Stop Illegal Financial Promotions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-financial-conduct-authority-takes-action-against-htx-to-stop-illegal-financia-2026210/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has begun legal proceedings against global crypto exchange HTX (formerly Huobi) for illegally promoting cryptoasset services to UK consumers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/statements/htx-huobi-legal-proceedings" title="Access documents on this clame on the FCA website">Access documents on this claim on the FCA website</a></p>
<p>Firms providing crypto products to UK consumers need to comply with rules which protect consumers from unfair and misleading marketing. Advertising cryptoassets on social media or websites without complying with these rules is a criminal offence.</p>
<p>Since the rules came into force in October 2023, the FCA has engaged extensively with firms, and the majority have reacted positively in complying with the new regime.</p>
<p>The FCA previously warned about HTX&rsquo;s illegal promotion of crypto services to UK consumers. However, it has continued to publish financial promotions in breach of these rules on its website and on social media platforms, including TikTok, X, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube.</p>
<p>HTX operates an opaque organisational structure, hiding the identities of its owners and the operators of its website. Repeated attempts by the FCA to engage with HTX have been ignored. Since issue of the proceedings, HTX has taken steps to restrict new UK customers from registering an account. However, existing UK users can still log in and access unlawful financial promotions, and HTX has given no assurance that the changes will be permanent. The FCA therefore remains concerned that the risk of ongoing breaches continues.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: 'Our rules are designed to support a sustainable and competitive crypto market in the UK, ensuring that consumers have what they need to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>'HTX&rsquo;s conduct stands in stark contrast to the majority of firms working to comply with the FCA&rsquo;s regime. This is the first time we&rsquo;ve taken enforcement action against a crypto firm illegally marketing their products to UK consumers. We&rsquo;ll continue to act against firms who ignore our rules.'</p>
<p>To protect consumers, the FCA requested social media companies block HTX&rsquo;s social media accounts to UK-based consumers and requested the removal of HTX applications from the Google Play and Apple stores in the UK.</p>
<p>HTX is currently on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/huobicom-htxcom-htx-and-or-huobi-global-and-or-huobi" title="FCA&rsquo;s Warning List">FCA&rsquo;s Warning List</a>. Consumers dealing with this firm will not have access to the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Financial Ombudsman Service (opens in a new window)">Financial Ombudsman Service<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;if they have a complaint.</p>
<p>Consumers are unlikely to get their money back if it goes out of business and should avoid dealing with this, or similar unauthorised firms.</p>
<p>Individuals can check the FCA&rsquo;s Warning List to see if a firm is operating illegally and visit the FCA&rsquo;s cryptoasset promotions page for more information on how to protect themselves.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/what-we-do/the-fca" title="FCA enables">FCA enables</a>&nbsp;a fair and thriving financial services market for the good of consumers and the economy.</li>
<li>Our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/corporate/our-strategy-2025-30.pdf" title="Strategy 2025-2030">strategy 2025-2030</a>&nbsp;prioritises fighting financial crime. Over the last 2 years, the FCA has charged more people with criminal offences and is concluding enforcement investigations faster.</li>
<li>Following legislation passed by Parliament, cryptoassets were brought within scope of the FCA&rsquo;s financial promotions regime.</li>
<li>From October 2023, all cryptoasset firms marketing to UK consumers, including firms based overseas, must comply with the regime.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has been clear that those who fail to play by the rules risk being placed on the FCA warning list, being subject to website take down requests or facing criminal or civil enforcement action.</li>

<title>ICE Introduces New MSP User Experience, Launches Next Phase Of Enhanced Servicing Automation - New UX Marks Milestone In MSP Modernization While Introducing Enhanced Escrow And Investor Reporting Automations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced a significant milestone in the modernization of its MSP&reg; mortgage servicing system with the launch of an enhanced user experience (UX). The new UX completes the first phase of a broader modernization initiative, establishing the groundwork for second-phase enhanced workflow automations and productivity agents already being introduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new UX is a foundational step in modernizing MSP,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Phase one is not just about improving platform navigability; it is already allowing us to roll out second-phase enhanced automation and AI-driven productivity agents that reduce manual effort and help servicers scale more efficiently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While MSP has supported exception-based automation for decades, the new UX enhancements make it possible to further reduce the volume of exceptions that require human review by consolidating remaining reviews into more efficient, single-screen workflows. ICE has prioritized enhanced automation for servicing processes that require the greatest manual intervention, with some early capabilities already available.</p>
<p>As part of this announcement, ICE has introduced phase two enhanced escrow and investor reporting automations, which are made possible by the updated UX. The enhanced escrow automation reduces manual touchpoints by as much as 87% and shortens cycle times from ten days to as few as two, while enhanced automation for Freddie Mac loan-level investor reporting cuts manual steps by as much as 68% for this high-frequency process.</p>
<p>ICE plans to continue to systematically deliver enhanced automations and productivity agents across the most manually intensive servicing tasks. These efforts are supported by the long-term modernization of MSP&rsquo;s underlying architecture, which is expected to facilitate faster feature development, broader use of emerging technologies, improved data accessibility and more efficient system management &mdash; ultimately helping servicers reduce system administration, shorten user training and improve margins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are deeply focused on delivering tangible ROI for our customers through continuous innovation,&rdquo; Hart added. &ldquo;MSP is already the most comprehensive mortgage servicing system on the market, and these enhancements not only support our customers today, but lay the groundwork for greater interoperability and faster feature development in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new UX can be easily adopted without reimplementation or disruption to current integrations. It builds on a series of recent servicing solution updates, including AI-based call prediction and account summarization capabilities, as well as deeper integration between ICE&rsquo;s servicing and origination solutions that allows homeowners to apply for home equity and refinance loans directly through their servicing portal.</p>
<p>Demos of the new MSP experience can be viewed at the MBA Servicing Solutions Conference and Expo, held February 16-19, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://mortgagetech.ice.com/experience/index" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">ICE Experience 2026</a>&nbsp;(X26) annual mortgage technology user conference, held March 16-18.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>LSEG and&nbsp;Apex Group today announce&nbsp;a&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;to connect&nbsp;private&nbsp;funds&nbsp;with&nbsp;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure (DMI), creating a transformative&nbsp;end-to-end digital distribution network for private funds. This&nbsp;collaboration&nbsp;will redefine how fund managers access capital and how investors discover and invest in private funds globally.</p>
<p>Digital&nbsp;Markets&nbsp;Infrastructure, which is powered by Microsoft Azure, delivers&nbsp;blockchain-powered scale and efficiencies for the full asset lifecycle - from issuance,&nbsp;tokenisation&nbsp;and distribution to post trade asset settlement and servicing, across multiple asset classes.</p>
<p>Apex Group&nbsp;brings&nbsp;$3.5tn in&nbsp;assets under administration&nbsp;and its global fund servicing infrastructure&nbsp;is&nbsp;the first service provider to connect with DMI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fund managers&nbsp;serviced by Apex&nbsp;Group&nbsp;can access DMI through&nbsp;Apex Group&rsquo;s Apex Digital Liquidity &amp; Distribution Service (Apex&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;3.0),&nbsp;a next-generation digital custody and distribution platform&nbsp;giving fund managers a single&nbsp;gateway to manage&nbsp;investors at&nbsp;scale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apex&nbsp;Digital&nbsp;3.0&nbsp;links directly into&nbsp;LSEG&rsquo;s Digital&nbsp;Markets&nbsp;Infrastructure&nbsp;which is fully integrated into LSEG&rsquo;s Workspace, giving access to over&nbsp;400,000 users&nbsp;and enabling funds to be visible to this global investor universe while&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;privacy and investor suitability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funds, whether long‑established&nbsp;or digitally native&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;are invited to join us on this journey as we open a new, more efficient path for global private‑markets distribution. We are increasingly indifferent if a company or fund is private or public, or if it is traditional or digital finance. By connecting through LSEG&rsquo;s Digital Markets Infrastructure, managers can seamlessly access a broader investor universe while&nbsp;benefiting&nbsp;from a secure, scalable, and future‑ready ecosystem.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;service will&nbsp;go live in H1 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr&nbsp;Darko Hajdukovic, Head of Digital Markets Infrastructure, LSEG, said: &ldquo;Our partnership with Apex&nbsp;Group&nbsp;represents&nbsp;a significant step toward digitising private markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;funds in&nbsp;particular.&nbsp;By&nbsp;working closely with&nbsp;Apex&nbsp;Group&rsquo;s global fund servicing capabilities with DMI, we are creating a secure, efficient, and scalable ecosystem that connects fund managers and investors. This collaboration&nbsp;will&nbsp;unlock&nbsp;new opportunities for innovation in private&nbsp;markets&nbsp;and&nbsp;enable&nbsp;participants to engage with private assets in a way that is faster, safer, and more connected than ever before."</p>
<p>Peter Hughes, Founder and CEO, Apex Group,&nbsp;said:&nbsp;"Private markets have lacked&nbsp;the direct&nbsp;connectivity and efficient investor aggregation needed to access global pools of capital efficiently. Together with LSEG,&nbsp;we're&nbsp;changing that. Apex Digital 3.0 utilises our Apex Invest platform to&nbsp;establish&nbsp;a seamless, many-to-one connection between fund managers and hard-to-reach capital sources, all linked directly through LSEG's distribution network via its global Workspace community.&nbsp;This&nbsp;initial&nbsp;phase automates the full investor lifecycle, while&nbsp;establishing&nbsp;the digital foundation for future blockchain- and AI-enabled connectivity across managers, institutions, and wealth platforms, paving the way for the next generation of private-market infrastructure.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Derivative Path</span>, a leading provider of cloud-based capital markets technology and risk management solutions, and&nbsp;<span>CloudMargin</span>, the only collateral and margin management solution purpose-built for the cloud, today announced a strategic partnership that will deliver a unified front-to-back workflow for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and collateral management. The collaboration enables seamless integration between Derivative Path&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>DerivativeEDGE&reg;</span>&nbsp;platform and CloudMargin&rsquo;s award-winning collateral management platform, enhancing operational efficiency and transparency for regional and community banks, and buy-side institutions.</p>
<p>The strategic alignment brings together two best-in-class technologies to solve an increasingly urgent market need: the ability to manage front-office activities, compliance, and collateral workflows in a unified, automated, and audit-ready environment. Integration is already underway, with the first clients expected to begin onboarding imminently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This partnership exemplifies what true complementarity looks like in capital markets technology,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacknagelberg/" target="_blank">Zack Nagelberg</a>, Chief Growth Officer at Derivative Path. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve built DerivativeEDGE to serve as the system of record and pre-and post-trade workflow engine for OTC derivatives. &nbsp;By integrating with CloudMargin&rsquo;s market-leading collateral platform, we are removing workflow friction for our clients while increasing control, transparency, and scalability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through single sign-on (SSO) access and automated data handoff between the platforms, clients will be able to accelerate onboarding, eliminate manual reconciliation, and meet their compliance and reporting obligations with ease. Legal entity and agreement data already housed in DerivativeEDGE can be ported into CloudMargin, reducing implementation timelines and minimizing setup friction.</p>
<p>CloudMargin CEO&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stuart-connolly-447939b/">Stuart Connolly</a>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;CloudMargin is proud to partner with Derivative Path to offer an end-to-end solution that transforms how banks and buy-side institutions manage their derivatives and collateral workflows. The combination of our straight-through processing (STP) and automated margin workflow and Derivative Path&rsquo;s market-proven derivatives platform provides clients with a future-proof foundation for regulatory compliance and operational resilience.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><span>Key Integration Benefits</span></h4>
<ul>
<li><span>End-to-End Workflow:</span>&nbsp;From trade execution to margin settlement, including valuations, margin calls, interest statements, and SWIFT connectivity to global custodians.</li>
<li>Time to Value:<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;Faster client onboarding with pre-integrated data flows between systems.</span></li>
<li>Compliance and Control<span style="font-size: 11px;">: Enhanced transparency, automated reporting, and audit readiness across both platforms.</span></li>
<li>Scalable Architecture:<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;Cloud-native systems designed for security, scalability, and resiliency.</span></li>

<title>Financial Markets Tribunal Upholds The Dubai Financial Services Authority’s Decision To Impose A Fine On Al Ramz Capital LLC Of USD 25,000 For Failing To Immediately Report Suspicious Transactions On NASDAQ Dubai</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/financial-markets-tribunal-upholds-the-dubai-financial-services-authoritys-deci-2026210/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA), the independent banking, financial services, and markets regulator of the Dubai International Financial Centre (DIFC) has today announced that the Financial Markets Tribunal has dismissed a reference by Al Ramz Capital LLC (Al Ramz) of a&nbsp;<a href="https://365343652932-web-server-storage.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/3917/7071/2788/Decision_Notice_Al_Ramz_Capital_LLC_Feb_2026_Redacted.pdf">DFSA Decision Notice</a>&nbsp;dated 13 June 2024.</p>
<p>On 3 February 2026, the Financial Markets Tribunal upheld the DFSA&rsquo;s decision to impose a USD 25,000 (AED 91,813) fine on Al Ramz for its failure to immediately report suspicious transactions that it had executed on Nasdaq Dubai on behalf of a Client in April 2022.<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Alan Linning, Managing Director of Enforcement at the DFSA, said:</span>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;This case is a firm reminder to Authorised Firms and Recognised Members that they must notify the DFSA immediately if they reasonably suspect that a client&rsquo;s order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse under the Markets Law, including market manipulation.</i></p>
<p><i>When a firm submits a notification by way of a Suspicious Transaction and Order Report (STOR), it should explain to the DFSA its reasons for suspecting that the order or transaction may constitute Market Abuse, and provide full details including the date, time, the name of the client and other parties involved and the nature of the investment (e.g. on-exchange or over-the-counter (OTC).</i></p>
<p><i>These reports are vital in assisting the DFSA in detecting and preventing Market Abuse. As a result, they are fundamental to maintaining market integrity and protecting investors and potential participants of DFSA administered markets. The DFSA will continue to hold Authorised Firms and Recognised Members to the high standards expected of them. We will not hesitate to take action where those high standards are not met.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The DFSA&rsquo;s case was that as a Recognised Member of Nasdaq Dubai, Al Ramz had reasonable grounds to suspect that the transactions in question may have constituted Market Abuse. In terms of the relevant DFSA rule, Al Ramz was therefore obliged to make a report to the DFSA immediately, but failed to do so.</p>
<p>Before the Financial Markets Tribunal, Al Ramz argued unsuccessfully that it had not breached the Rule because it did not actually suspect Market Abuse in relation to the transactions in question.</p>
<p>In its decision, the Financial Markets Tribunal rejected Al Ramz&rsquo;s interpretation of the Rule stating:</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;In our view, the proper construction of the REC 3.4.5&nbsp;</i>[<i>the relevant rule</i>]<i>&nbsp;leads to the conclusion that the obligation to notify the DFSA of potential Market Abuse arises where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting Market Abuse in a purely objective sense irrespective of whether the Recognised Member actually suspects Market Abuse.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The Financial Markets Tribunal confirmed the DFSA&rsquo;s decision that on the information known to Al Ramz at the relevant time, there existed, objectively, reasonable grounds to suspect the trades may constitute Market Abuse. On this basis, the Financial Markets Tribunal upheld the DFSA&rsquo;s decision to impose the USD 25,000 fine on Al Ramz.</p>
<p>The DFSA remains committed to developing, administering, and enforcing world-class regulations of financial services within the DIFC. As part of its strategy and ongoing mission, the Authority will continue to implement stringent enforcement measures and provide clear regulatory guidance to ensure that all entities operating within the Centre adhere to the highest standards of regulation and ethical conduct.</p>
<p>The DFSA's Decision Notice is accessible in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/what-we-do/enforcement/regulatory-actions" target="_blank">Regulatory Actions section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA website. Al Ramz Capital LLC (Al Ramz) has 28 days after the date of the Financial Markets Tribunal&rsquo;s decision to appeal the decision. The Financial Markets Tribunal&rsquo;s decision is available in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dfsa.ae/about-dfsa/our-structure/financial-markets-tribunal" target="_blank">FMT section</a>&nbsp;of the DFSA&rsquo;s website. ​​​​​</p>

<title>FIX Recommends Regulatory Approaches To AI In Trading: Monetary Authority Of Singapore Consultation</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/fix-recommends-regulatory-approaches-to-ai-in-trading-monetary-authority-of-sin-2026210/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FIX Trading Community, the industry association that manages the world&rsquo;s trading language, the FIX Protocol, has proposed ten key recommendations for regulating AI in trading, in response to the Monetary Authority of Singapore&rsquo;s (MAS) consultation,&nbsp;<i>Consultation Paper on Guidelines on Artificial Intelligence Risk Management</i>, which closed on January 31.</p>
<p>Executive Director Jim Kaye said the consultation was both valuable and timely, enabling FIX and its member firms to come together to address the complex issue of AI, with which all firms around the world are currently grappling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was an immensely useful exercise in teasing out both overarching themes and technical challenges,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s allowed us to propose some practical measures that will be very helpful to firms as we, as an industry, meet the risks and opportunities that AI presents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Machine learning has been the backbone of algorithmic trading for decades, but the advent of large language models, and high-profile examples of their failings, have thrown AI into the spotlight. The interconnected nature of global markets means that one AI catastrophe could potentially have far-reaching consequences, and the speed at which the AI industry is moving means both regulators and participants are highly focused on this topic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This consultation allowed us to think about AI from all angles &ndash; from Board accountability (critical) to existing frameworks that could be used to help manage AI risks,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;The MAS proposals are an excellent start &ndash; we think that with some additional depth, they will be a good framework for firms to manage risk as AI adoption moves ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>FIX&rsquo;s recommendations include ten key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Agreeing a globally recognised definition and taxonomy for what &ldquo;AI&rdquo; means in a trading context. Without this, and particularly if firms are left to define AI for themselves, there will be inconsistency between both firms and markets, and regulatory arbitrage. Standards and publications that can be referenced include Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and ISO 24030.</li>
<li>Making Boards accountable for AI governance effectiveness &ndash; not just AI governance existence.</li>
<li>Anchoring AI regulatory guidelines to existing constructs for operational resilience and market integrity, such as MiFID RTS 6 which requires firms to both annually self-assess and validate their algo trading systems as well as to certify non-contribution to market disorder on every significant change; and the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) ICT risk management frameworks.</li>
<li>Specifically considering the way large language models (LLMs) are integrated into algorithms and calculators, including potential downstream workflow and decision-making impacts.</li>
<li>Establishing cross-functional committees to ensure risk management across the organisation, and ensuring these committees also have oversight of third-party AI-related suppliers.</li>
<li>Creating internal and regulator-facing disclosure patterns analogous to food labelling: what data was used, training approach, evaluation results, mitigations, limitations, intended use, and user-data protection.</li>
<li>Supporting the creation and maintenance of AI inventories, the granularity of which will necessarily be well beyond typical algo inventories.</li>
<li>Imposing the proposed risk dimensions of impact, complexity and reliance with the addition of a further two dimension: interconnectedness/contagion potential; and change sensitivity/nonlinearity &ndash; ie the butterfly effect, where small changes can lead to material&nbsp;differences in AI behaviour.</li>
<li>Strengthening the proposed standards, processes and controls through the AI lifecycle. FIX Trading Community&rsquo;s significant work on algorithm testing and certification could be referenced here.</li>
<li>Revising the definition of &ldquo;significant/material change&rdquo; so that retraining, data refreshes, fine-tuning, prompt/policy-layer changes, and infrastructure/latency changes are each evaluated under a clear, risk-based materiality test, that may require re-approval and re-testing.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt that Silicon Valley&rsquo;s &lsquo;move fast and break things&rsquo; approach is at odds with the conservative approach that must be taken to protect the integrity of our global capital markets,&rdquo; Kaye said. &ldquo;When it comes to AI, it&rsquo;s critical that the entire capital markets industry works together to ensure we protect our financial system as well as we possibly can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The FIX Trading Community is the only independent global community where capital markets firms come together to solve common issues and shape the evolution of capital markets. FIX groups in over 60 countries are working on a range of global issues including digital assets; reference data; carbon trading; AI; algo trading; FICC and ETFs, while country and regional committees work together to manage local regulation and market structure matters.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASX Limited (ASX) announces today that Managing Director and CEO Helen Lofthouse will step down in May 2026, following an 11 year career at ASX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appointed CEO in 2022, the announcement of Ms Lofthouse&rsquo;s planned departure comes as ASX makes final preparations to deliver the first phase of the CHESS project which is targeting go-live in April 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having overseen a new transformation agenda and technology modernisation program, and with the CHESS project on firm footing, the Board and Ms Lofthouse have determined it is the right time for new leadership to take the Group into its next phase of transformation.</p>
<p><b>ASX Chair David Clarke said:</b> &ldquo;Helen took the CEO role at an exceptionally challenging time for ASX. She took the difficult decision to stop the previous CHESS project and reset it, and she has driven a significant uplift in our technology investment and delivery, and risk focus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After careful consideration, and as we approach go-live for CHESS Release 1, the Board and Helen have agreed this marks an appropriate turning point to commence the transition to a new CEO.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be looking for a new leader to extend the foundations built in recent years and drive the business forward while keeping customers and the market at the heart of our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Ms Lofthouse said:</b> &ldquo;It has been a privilege to serve at ASX for more than a decade and to spend four years leading an organisation that is at centre of Australia&rsquo;s financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since becoming CEO we have reset the CHESS project, refreshed our strategy, expanded technology investment and delivered a series of technology and resilience upgrades. While the pace of change has been intense in recent years, I&rsquo;m very proud of our achievements in modernising technology, enhancing customer engagement, developing Group capabilities, and shifting our culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a rewarding but demanding journey with enormous personal growth. Having reflected on what ASX needs for its next phase, together with the Board we have agreed that this is the right time for a new person to bring fresh energy to the work ahead. We&rsquo;ve made great strides even as we&rsquo;ve faced challenges and I want to thank everyone at ASX for their dedication and support&nbsp; and our customers for their partnership.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Succession</h2>
<p>The Board has engaged Korn Ferry to support a comprehensive process to identify our next CEO. The global search will also consider internal candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Clarke said: &ldquo;Our search process is underway and we will assess leaders who have strong credentials in financial markets, transformation and risk management. The Board has confidence in the capability and experience of ASX&rsquo;s executive leadership team, and internal candidates will be considered alongside external candidates as part of a robust process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the search process will be comprehensive, it will not slow our momentum to deliver strategic priorities and the Board maintains ongoing and active oversight. Our Executive team remain fully accountable for execution of key deliverables and there is no change to our major initiatives and programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;The Board&rsquo;s focus is on operating reliable, resilient critical market infrastructure and ensuring we play an active stewardship role to deliver a future-focused exchange.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>Investor demand exceeded USD 1.3 billion, representing a 2.6x oversubscription from regional and international investors.</li>
<li>Total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai now exceeds USD 147.3 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nasdaq Dubai has welcomed the listing of a USD 500 million bond issued by Arab Bank for Investment and Foreign Trade PJSC (Al Masraf), marking the Bank&rsquo;s debut in the international debt capital markets and reinforcing Dubai&rsquo;s position as a leading hub for global fixed-income issuances.</p>
<p>Issued under Al Masraf&rsquo;s USD 5 billion Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme, the five-year bond matures on 29 January 2031 and carries a coupon of 5.113% per annum, equivalent to a credit spread of 125 basis points over U.S. Treasuries. The issuance attracted strong investor demand, with the order book peaking at over USD 1.3 billion, representing an oversubscription rate of 2.6 times.</p>
<p>The transaction drew participation from a diversified base of regional and international investors, including some of the world&rsquo;s largest fund managers, banks, private banks, pension funds, and insurance companies. The mandate for the issuance was announced on 16 January, with pricing completed on 22 January following a series of investor meetings held across Hong Kong, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the UAE.</p>
<p>Rated &lsquo;A&rsquo; by Fitch, the bond is listed on both the London Stock Exchange&rsquo;s International Securities Market and Nasdaq Dubai.</p>
<p>To mark the listing, Fuad Mohamed, CEO, Al Masraf, rang the market-opening bell at Nasdaq Dubai, alongside Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and Dubai Financial Market (DFM), and senior representatives from both organizations.</p>
<p><b>Fuad Mohamed, CEO of Al Masraf,</b> stated: &ldquo;The strong investor demand, reflects the investors&rsquo; belief in Al Masraf&rsquo;s renewed strategic direction, reinforced management, and the positive strides on financial metrics over the last 12 months. Our capital market debut in the Bank&rsquo;s Golden Jubilee year allows us to penetrate the international markets and reach out to a diverse investor base while at the same time reinvigorates the relations with our esteemed regional partners.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Hamed Ali, CEO of Nasdaq Dubai and DFM, </b>said<b>: </b>&ldquo;Al Masraf&rsquo;s debut bond listing reflects strong and sustained investor confidence in high-quality regional issuers and underscores the continued development of the UAE&rsquo;s debt capital markets. The strong response to this issuance reflects the quality of the credit and the continued appeal of Dubai as a venue for international debt listings, reinforcing the role of Dubai&rsquo;s markets in supporting regional issuers&rsquo; access to global capital.&rdquo;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The total outstanding value of debt securities listed on Nasdaq Dubai exceeds USD <b>147.3</b> billion. This reflects the depth and diversity of issuers accessing Dubai&rsquo;s international debt markets across sovereign, financial institution, and corporate segments.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>SGX Group (Singapore Exchange) today reported robust trading activity for January, with record exchange-traded fund (ETF) turnover and stronger participation from both retail and institutional investors driving growth in its stock market. Derivatives volume across equities, FX and commodities rose to the highest in almost six years, reflecting continued institutional demand for trusted risk-management tools.</p>
<p>Turnover value in the stock market increased 66% year-on-year (y-o-y) in January to S$34.6 billion, with securities daily average value (SDAV) up 58% y-o-y at S$1.65 billion. Derivatives total traded volume climbed 34% y-o-y to 32.1 million contracts &ndash; the highest since March 2020 &ndash; while derivatives daily average volume (DAV) gained 27% y-o-y to about 1.6 million contracts.</p>
<p>Key highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Growing interest in stocks beyond benchmark index:&nbsp;</strong>Stock market momentum<strong>&nbsp;</strong>in January was broad based across all client segments, with demand extending beyond index names as more stocks achieved at least S$1 million in daily turnover. Institutions net purchased into index as well as small- and mid-cap stocks. The Monetary Authority of Singapore and SGX Stock Exchange also launched the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgx.com/value-unlock">Value Unlock</a>&nbsp;programme during the month. The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) advanced 5.6% month-on-month (m-o-m) to 4,905.13, outperforming most ASEAN peers. </li>
<li><strong>Capital raising accelerates:</strong>&nbsp;SGX Stock Exchange welcomed two new listings on Catalist during the month:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20260123-sgx-stock-exchange-welcomes-assembly-place-holdings-ltd-catalist">The Assembly Place Holdings Ltd.</a>, Singapore&rsquo;s largest community-living operator, on 23 January, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgxgroup.com/media-centre/20260122-sgx-stock-exchange-welcomes-toku-ltd-catalist">Toku Ltd.</a>, a leading customer-experience platform, on 22 January.

The contract is the most liquid Taiwan index futures approved by the U.S. CFTC for global investors to manage their Taiwan exposures. Similarly, the SGX Micro FTSE Taiwan Index Futures capped a strong month with DAV of 6,430 lots (US$67 million notional), a record high.</li>
<li><strong>FX futures set new records:&nbsp;</strong>SGX USD/CNH FX Futures traded volume gained 30% y-o-y in January to a new monthly record of 4.5 million contracts (US$448 billion notional) as the RMB continued to strengthen against the dollar, while SGX INR/USD FX Futures volume rose 56% y-o-y to 3.0 million contracts amid heightened volatility &ndash; lifting total FX futures volume to an all-time high of 8.3 million contracts.&nbsp;With the shifting rate environment in Japan, SGX Derivatives broadened its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sgx.com/derivatives/interest-rate-derivatives">interest rate derivatives</a>&nbsp;offering with the launch of SGX Mini 20-Year Japanese Government Bond Futures on 26 January.</li>
<li><strong>Broad-based commodities volume growth:</strong>&nbsp;Commodities traded volume expanded 54% y-o-y in January to 6.8 million contracts, with gains across bellwether iron ore, petrochemicals, freight and rubber derivatives. SGX SICOM rubber futures and options volume rose 51% m-o-m to 359,115 contracts, the highest since April 2025.

<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, February&nbsp;３, 2026, ８:51&nbsp;am to ９:05&nbsp;am)</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><dl class="qanda"><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Press reports indicate that the FSA initiated an on-site inspection of The Prudential Life Insurance Company, Ltd. on January 29 over suspected improper handling of funds and other misconduct. The reports also state that the inspection, previously scheduled for February 5, was moved forward. Could you confirm whether this is accurate? In addition, please share your views on the case and the FSA&rsquo;s policy response.</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>We are aware of the reports in question. In light of multiple instances at the company involving inappropriate handling of funds by employees and former employees with respect to policyholders and others, the FSA is also examining the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information and the actual state of its sales practices. At this stage, it would be premature to comment on factual matters, including the company&rsquo;s handling of customer information, and we will therefore refrain from doing so. In any event, based on our findings, we will take strict and appropriate supervisory action.</p>

<title>EACH’s Women In Clearing Series – Getting Inspired By María José Gómez Yubero, Head Of Resolution At CNMV</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-getting-inspired-by-mara-jos-gmez-yubero-h-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 the&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series&nbsp;</b>was inaugurated. This is an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.</p>
<p>We begin the New Year with inspiration from&nbsp;Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;. Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; is a financial regulator at the Spanish National Securities Market Commission (CNMV), where she works on financial stability, resolution and market infrastructures, with a particular focus on central counterparties (CCPs). She has extensive experience in supervision, investor protection, financial stability, and international cooperation, and actively contributes to global discussions on clearing, resolution and financial market resilience.</p>
<p>She is committed to modern, effective and citizen-oriented supervision, aligned with the principles of market integrity, transparency and investor protection, which form part of her professional DNA. Alongside her regulatory work, she is engaged in academic research and teaching in financial regulation, and is passionate about reading, culture and lifelong learning. Her leadership style is collaborative, inclusive and results-oriented, with a strong focus on teamwork, trust and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute;&nbsp;has volunteered to share with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get to where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key aspects I had to work on was my own confidence. Early in my career, especially in highly technical and traditionally male-dominated environments, I had to learn not to underestimate myself or hesitate to step forward. Experience taught me that competence grows through&nbsp;<i>learning by doing</i>, and that credibility and authority are built by leading by example, consistency and hard work, by striving for excellence and genuinely enjoying what you do, whatever your role may be. Over time, I also learned the importance of trusting my own judgement while remaining open to learning from others through active listening, as well as the value of a strong humanistic education in broadening perspective and enriching professional growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>My main advice would be to invest continuously in learning, not only technical skills but also broader knowledge and human skills. Keeping an open mind, listening carefully, and understanding the perspectives of different stakeholders is essential, particularly in complex sectors such as clearing. I would also stress the value of mentoring, intergenerational and multidisciplinary teamwork, and building strong, cohesive teams. Finally, never feel inferior or afraid of new challenges. Commitment, curiosity and teamwork make a real difference over time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>In the next decade, clearing will become even more central to financial stability, while undergoing a profound technological and structural transformation. Central counterparties will operate in a more digital, interconnected and accelerated environment, marked by shorter settlement cycles, the move towards continuous trading, greater automation, and the gradual integration of technologies such as distributed ledger technology and artificial intelligence, with the potential medium-term application of quantum computing. These innovations will enhance efficiency and transparency, but will also shift risks towards operational resilience, cyber security, liquidity management and governance, requiring crisis management and resolution frameworks to evolve accordingly, and authorities, infrastructures and market participants to remain continuously prepared for stress scenarios.</p>
<p>At the same time, the future of clearing in Europe will depend less on the degree of concentration of infrastructures and more on effective interoperability, coordinated supervision and strong institutional cooperation. A diversified but well-connected clearing ecosystem, supported by robust regulatory frameworks, will be key to combining innovation, competitiveness and systemic resilience in an increasingly global and digital financial system.</p>
<p>You could hear more about Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; by&nbsp;<b><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7426646737064185857" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">watching this video link</a>&nbsp;</b>or by reading the attached document and using&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eachccp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Maria-Jose-Gomez-Yubero-Head-of-Resolution-CNMV.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">this link</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to thank Mar&iacute;a Jos&eacute; for her insightful contribution! We look forward to continuing the EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series by hosting many skilled women leaders to inspire other professionals in the clearing sector!</p>

<p>The U.S. Treasury market remains the cornerstone of global financial stability, supporting everything from mortgage pricing to corporate financing to central bank reserves. With nearly $29 trillion in marketable Treasury debt,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3">[3]</a>&nbsp;it is the deepest and most liquid capital market in the world. Its smooth functioning depends on the coordinated efforts of countless stakeholders&mdash;including market participants, clearing agencies, infrastructure providers, and other regulators.</p>
<p>I first became involved in discussions regarding the potential mandatory clearing of Treasuries when I served on detail to the U.S. Department of the Treasury in 2017. Eventually, there would be widespread consensus with respect to the benefits of mandatory Treasury clearing. Using a central counterparty can improve transparency and reduce bilateral exposures. The ability to use netting for offsetting transactions can free up additional cash for market participants, which in turn can reduce liquidity strains. Accordingly, in December 2023, I voted with a majority of SEC Commissioners to adopt standards to mandate central clearing of Treasury securities for transactions in the cash and repo markets.</p>
<p>Recent research by the Office of Financial Research (&ldquo;OFR&rdquo;) reemphasizes these benefits of central clearing in the Treasury repo market. In a back-testing analysis of repo and reverse repo positions reported by six global systemically important banks (&ldquo;G-SIBs&rdquo;) during the first eight months of 2025, OFR calculated that if the Treasury Clearing Rule had been in effect during this period, each U.S. G-SIB could have freed up an average of $34.5 billion in additional balance sheet space.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>
<p>In its 2025 Annual Report released by the Trump Administration, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (&ldquo;FSOC&rdquo;) underscored the potential benefits of central clearing of Treasury transactions and expressed support for the SEC as it continues working towards the implementation of the Treasury Clearing Rule.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5">[5]</a>&nbsp;So, with that momentum, the SEC continues to undertake extensive outreach to mitigate any issues with the upcoming deadlines.</p>
<h2>A. Progress Made</h2>
<p>Despite the potential benefits of clearing Treasury transactions, I recognized at the time the SEC adopted the rule, that it would take extensive time, effort, and resources to develop the workflows and processes to integrate market participants into the clearing infrastructure. Given this significant work, it became apparent that the original implementation timeline was too short.</p>
<p>For that reason, upon becoming SEC Acting Chairman, I pushed for a 12-month extension of those deadlines. I was pleased that both of my then-colleagues, Commissioners Hester Peirce and Caroline Crenshaw, unanimously agreed to the extension.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6">[6]</a></p>
<p>At the time, the February 2025 extension would provide market participants with 22 months to prepare for implementation with respect to cash transactions. Now, that implementation date is less than eleven months away. Thanks to efforts of many, including those who are in this room, we have been able to collectively identify a number of concerns, and the SEC is committed to promptly addressing them.</p>
<p>Our efforts have been focused in three areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, reviewing applications and proposals aimed at expanding access to, and options for, clearing Treasury securities;</li>
<li>Second, providing guidance on the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule, including consideration for providing additional flexibility to ensure that market participants can access liquidity and manage collateral; and</li>
<li>Third, maintaining a collaborative and transparent approach to implementation.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will address each of these in turn.</p>
<h2>B. Developments in Clearing</h2>
<h3>New Clearing Agencies</h3>
<p>Until recently, there was only a single SEC-registered clearing agency for Treasury securities, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (&ldquo;FICC&rdquo;). In the last two months, however, the SEC has approved the applications of CME Securities Clearing Inc. and ICE Clear Credit LLC to register as clearing agencies for Treasury securities transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7">[7]</a>&nbsp;These approvals will provide market participants the necessary certainty as to which entities can serve as clearing agencies for Treasury securities and what services they will offer.</p>
<p>Obtaining SEC approval is not an easy process. Section 17A(b)(3) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (&ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;) sets forth the requirements that an applicant must meet in order to register as a clearing agency.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8">[8]</a>&nbsp;These requirements include whether the entity is so organized and has the capacity to provide the functions of a clearing agency, whether its rules provide for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions, and whether its rules assure a fair representation of its shareholders or members and participants in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs. These requirements guide the Commission&rsquo;s consideration of a clearing agency application, and the Commission must find that an applicant can meet these requirements. In the case of the two new clearing agencies, the Commission made those findings.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9">[9]</a></p>
<p>Now, with three clearing agencies approved for Treasury securities, market participants will have expanded options for accessing clearing to implement their obligations under the Treasury Clearing Rule. We encourage market participants, who may have questions about the operations of these clearing agencies in relation to their own regulatory obligations, to engage with the central counterparties. If needed, the SEC staff stands ready to be part of those discussions.</p>
<h3>Rule Changes in Clearing</h3>
<p>Besides reviewing applications from new market entrants, the SEC staff has also been reviewing proposals from FICC to support the Treasury Clearing Rule. On December 22, 2025, the Commission published notice of FICC&rsquo;s proposed rule change to amend its cross-margining agreement with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Inc. (&ldquo;CME&rdquo;) to expand its existing cross-margining arrangement with CME to customers. Currently, the arrangement is limited to the proprietary positions of FICC and CME members.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10">[10]</a>&nbsp;Relatedly, the Commission is considering petitions submitted by FICC and CME for exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Exchange Act that would permit expanded cross-margining for customers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Historically, the Commission has supported and approved cross-margining at clearing agencies and recognized the potential benefits of cross-margining systems. These benefits include freeing up capital through reduced margin requirements, reducing clearing costs by integrating clearing functions, reducing clearing agency risk by centralizing asset management, and harmonizing liquidation procedures. In addition, we understand that certain market participants view an expansion of cross-margining between cash and futures Treasury positions to be an important component of the transition to increased central clearing of Treasury securities. The current proposal from FICC and CME is still outstanding. The Commission must review and consider comments submitted by the public and take them into consideration as it determines whether to approve the proposed rule change.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Commission acted this past December on two proposals from FICC that are aimed at expanding access to clearing ahead of the Treasury Clearing Rule compliance dates. Specifically, the Commission approved a proposed new offering from FICC to establish a &ldquo;collateral-in-lieu&rdquo; service as part of the existing sponsored general collateral service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12">[12]</a>&nbsp;This service would allow FICC to take a lien on the collateral underlying a repo transaction in lieu of charging margin. In most instances, the lien will obviate FICC&rsquo;s need to collect margin or to obtain a guarantee on the transactions. This service would address what market participants have referred to as &ldquo;double margining&rdquo; that increases the costs, and thereby decreases the ability, of a FICC sponsoring member to provide clearance and settlement services to mutual funds and other cash providers. Second, the Commission issued an order approving expansion of FICC&rsquo;s agent clearing service to include triparty transactions, which should provide an additional option for market participants using that service.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13">[13]</a></p>
<h2>C. Guidance on the Scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule</h2>
<p>The SEC has also been engaging with market participants about the scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule. SEC staff has provided guidance in some areas, such as mixed CUSIP triparty repos,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14">[14]</a>&nbsp;but has yet to resolve some other questions.</p>
<h3>Flexibility for Inter-Affiliate Transactions</h3>
<p>One area where market participants have asked for further regulatory clarity is the application of the Treasury Clearing Rule to inter-affiliate transactions.</p>
<p>When the Commission proposed the Treasury Clearing Rule, the definition of an eligible secondary market transaction provided no exception for inter-affiliate transactions. Commenters, however, asserted that inter-affiliate transactions are important for corporate groups, which use them to achieve efficient risk and capital allocation and to obtain flexibility for addressing customer demands. Further, commenters noted that requiring inter-affiliate transactions to be centrally cleared would impose additional costs but have only limited benefits.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15">[15]</a></p>
<p>Thus, the final rule included an exemption for inter-affiliate transactions. The Commission recognized that inter-affiliate transactions represent an important tool to transfer liquidity and risk within an affiliated group. The Commission also recognized that, in certain circumstances, the counterparty credit risk posed by inter-affiliate transactions may be less than other transactions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The inter-affiliate exemption provides that a direct participant of a central counterparty would not have to clear its inter-affiliate transactions if (i) the affiliate was under common control and was either a bank, broker-dealer or a futures commission merchant, and (ii) the direct participant also submitted for clearing the outward-facing transactions of that affiliate.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17">[17]</a></p>
<p>As the Adopting Release explained, &ldquo;this [outward facing] condition&rdquo; was intended to ensure that a direct participant could not rely upon an inter-affiliate transaction to avoid the requirement to clear eligible secondary market transactions. If there were no such condition, a direct participant could simply use inter-affiliate transactions to move securities and funds to affiliates, and the affiliated counterparty could then enter into external transactions with counterparties which, if entered into as a direct participant of a Treasury securities covered clearing agency, would be eligible secondary market transactions. Because the clearing requirement is conditioned on one of the parties being a direct participant, this would undermine the clearing requirement. Under the outward-facing condition, however, the transfer of Treasury securities between a direct participant and its non-direct participant affiliate would only be exempt from the clearing requirement if the non-direct participant affiliate cleared all of its other Treasury repo transactions.</p>
<p>Because the final inter-affiliate exemption had not been exposed to public review, market participants raised a number of concerns, including with respect to the types of entities that can be affiliates for purposes of the exemption and the requirement to clear the outward-facing transactions of the affiliate. SEC staff has been working with market participants to better understand these concerns and how they can be addressed.</p>
<p>Specifically, SEC staff have been considering whether broadening the contours of that exemption could be workable without creating a significant loophole that undermines the purposes of the rule. For example, could the provision that the affiliate be a bank, broker-dealer, or futures commission merchant be modified to allow for more types of entities as affiliates? SEC staff are also considering other potential relief for the inter-affiliate exemption so that market participants can maintain their current business practices for liquidity, treasury, and collateral management. The Commission has received productive feedback from market participants on the inter-affiliate exemption, and my hope is that any potential modifications can be publicly rolled out in the near future, since the compliance date is fast approaching.</p>
<h3>Extra-Territorial Reach</h3>
<p>The extraterritorial scope of the Treasury Clearing Rule is another area where the SEC staff have engaged in additional outreach efforts. Non-U.S. firms that trade with U.S. counterparties do not typically centrally clear their trades in Treasury securities. Accordingly, it is not surprising that an industry survey on U.S. Treasury central clearing readiness, released last fall, showed lower levels of understanding of the Treasury Clearing Rule amongst non-U.S. firms and lower levels of confidence that these firms would be ready to fulfill their obligations by the extended compliance dates.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18">[18]</a>&nbsp;The SEC is aware that these firms may have larger burdens than U.S. firms in establishing clearing arrangements with intermediaries or central counterparties.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19">[19]</a>&nbsp;SEC staff have been engaging with market participants to understand the jurisdictional issues, and I hope we can address such concerns in the near future.</p>
<h2>D. Maintaining a Transparent and Collaborative Approach</h2>
<p>There are other areas where implementing the Treasury Clearing Rule has raised questions for market participants about how they should comply with other existing requirements under the federal securities laws.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20">[20]</a>&nbsp;We acknowledge the need for guidance and SEC staff continue to engage with market participants on these questions.</p>
<p>To maximize transparency regarding the SEC&rsquo;s efforts, we have provided periodic public updates and maintain a comprehensive list of actions taken on a dedicated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/securities-topics/treasury-clearing-implementation">Treasury Clearing implementation webpage</a>&nbsp;on sec.gov.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Materials posted to this dedicated website also are intended to keep market participants informed about the additional work that is underway. Thus, if you see no mention of a particular concern on that website, then it is highly likely that we are not actively working on it&mdash;so we strongly encourage firms to identify and raise any remaining challenges or unforeseen issues as we move towards full implementation.</p>
<p>The Commission continues its collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the Federal Reserve Board, the CFTC, and international regulators to ensure seamless cross-border implementation. It is in all of our interests to see that the U.S. Treasury securities market remains the deepest, most liquid, and most resilient market in the world.</p>
<h1>II. Why Tokenization Matters and Where We Stand</h1>
<p>One of the other issues that the Commission is taking a close look at is tokenization, a development that could change the way securities are issued, traded, and managed. It also raises important questions about liquidity, collateral practices, and clearing models, as well as the legal and regulatory frameworks needed to support these changes.</p>
<p>Technology has long shaped the way our markets operate&mdash;from paper certificates to dematerialized shares, from physical trading floors to electronic order books. Today, we consider the possibility of migrating securities positions from traditional databases to blockchain-based systems, and tokenization representing these rights and obligations on-chain.</p>
<p>Properly implemented, tokenization can enhance security, transparency, and immutability by encoding rights on digital tokens and recording their provenance on distributed ledgers. It can reduce reliance on intermediaries, streamline transaction lifecycles, and lower operational costs&mdash;without sacrificing safeguards that have long protected investors.</p>
<p>Potential technological shifts challenge us to translate existing laws and regulations into new contexts. Today, many of the SEC&rsquo;s rules assume multi-layered intermediation. However, tokenization offers a pathway to more direct issuer&ndash;investor interactions on open, programmable rails. Market demand and confidence should drive whether tokenization becomes reality, and the SEC&rsquo;s rulebook should not impose unnecessary roadblocks.</p>
<h2>A. Innovation with Guardrails</h2>
<p>In that sense, SEC rules should be technology-neutral and be focused on outcomes, not solely processes. Tokenized versions of securities remain subject to securities regulation; the shift does not change the legal and regulatory obligations. The challenge is to adapt the rules&mdash;on issuance, custody, and trading to name a few&mdash;so that those obligations can be met in on-chain environments.</p>
<p>To date, SEC efforts in engagement have been through roundtables, staff statements, and public comment files. Under the Trump Administration, the SEC has ceased using enforcement as the principal method for expressing Commission views on these new technological developments. In that sense, the SEC has returned to its normal approach of providing sub-regulatory guidance and exploring exemptive relief to allow limited-scope pilots to proceed under defined parameters, thereby informing potential future Commission action. This is the same tried-and-true process that gave rise to money market funds and exchange-traded funds in the past.</p>
<p>Tokenization can help modernize capital markets, not only by speeding up the settlement cycle but by making ownership more visible&mdash;addressing current challenges in shareholder identification and corporate actions. Visibility and speed are not merely aesthetic improvements; they are core to fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and the Commission should be continually thinking about how these new developments can be incorporated into the markets.</p>
<h2>B. Looking Ahead: Opportunities and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Recently, the Commission provided public notice of an exemptive application under the Investment Company Act that demonstrates how tokenization is no longer a theoretical exercise, but is becoming a practical reality.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-asset-management-derivatives-forum-020926?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn22">[22]</a>&nbsp;This milestone reflects the Commission&rsquo;s commitment to innovation without abandoning appropriate guardrails such as ensuring that custody, disclosure, and investor protection standards are in place when assets migrate on-chain. It also exemplifies a pragmatic roadmap&mdash;beginning with scoped efforts, learning from the results, and potentially scaling what works.</p>
<p>By moving forward with such applications, the Commission signals that it is open to modernization, provided that it adheres to achieving the objectives of longstanding laws and regulations that govern the securities markets. I hope that these exemptive order applications are not endpoints, but rather waypoints on a journey toward markets that are more fair, orderly, and efficient due to new innovations.</p>
<h2>C. First Principles, Enduring Mission</h2>
<p>Expectations vary: some predict rapid transformation while others caution that adoption might take years. The Commission&rsquo;s responsibility is to ensure that its regulations evolve as technology evolves&mdash;for the very same reason that the SEC cannot regulate in 2026 in the same manner as in 1934, when the agency was created.</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s goal should be neither to bless every new innovation nor to resist change reflexively. Rather, it is to use its regulatory tools&mdash;including definitional authority and exemptive relief&mdash;so that the administration of the federal securities laws can evolve to address new technologies and innovation. Part of this responsibility includes providing transparency as to what is permitted, what requires prior authorization, and what is prohibited.</p>
<p>If financial regulators can carry out this process in an appropriate manner, capital markets will be able to operate in ways that reduce friction, improve price discovery, and serve investors better than ever before. Ultimately, that is the real objective of financial regulation.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, both Treasury clearing and tokenization serve as reminders that modernization is not an abstract goal&mdash;it is a practical necessity for resilient, transparent, and efficient markets. These initiatives demand continued engagement with market participants, robust consideration of benefits and costs, thoughtful evaluation of trade-offs among alternative approaches, and a respect for the legal authority governing the SEC&rsquo;s activities, including the procedural obligations required by the Administrative Procedure Act. These efforts are not simple and may take time, but they are essential. By approaching these changes methodically, the Commission can strengthen market infrastructure, promote responsible innovation, and ensure that America&rsquo;s capital markets continue to serve investors and the broader economy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Fran&ccedil;ois Villeroy de Galhau, Governor of the Bank of France, today announced his decision to leave the Bank of France at the beginning of June to become President of the Fondation Apprentis d'Auteuil. Accordingly, he will step down from his position as Chair of the BIS Board of Directors.</p>

His commitment to fostering global monetary and financial stability and to enhance the resilience of the financial system is deeply appreciated.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>On a personal level, I also worked alongside Fran&ccedil;ois in many forums, including during my tenure as Chair of the Basel Committee, and together with him as a member of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank. I am deeply grateful for his strategic leadership as well as his commitment to the public interest and to the pursuit of international cooperation. I will miss his optimism and principled approach to leadership. He has also become a valued friend and I wish him every success.</p>

<title>The EBA Launches Consultation On Simplifying The Credit Risk Framework</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-launches-consultation-on-simplifying-the-credit-risk-framework-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-launches-consultation-on-simplifying-the-credit-risk-framework-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) launched today a public consultation on its Discussion Paper on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework.&nbsp;The Paper sets out preliminary ideas to enhance the usability, efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework, aiming to stimulate a broader discussion on how to better structure the EBA&rsquo;s future work in this area. Based on the comments received, the EBA will assess potential simplifications as part of its future policy work. The consultation runs until 10 May 2026.</span></p>
<p>The EBA&rsquo;s 2025&nbsp;<a href="https://eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-10/b8e0ef8e-2d49-43fc-b917-dbca3423588c/Report%20on%20the%20efficiency%20of%20the%20regulatory%20and%20supervisory%20framework.pdf">Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework</a>&nbsp;introduced a set of principles aimed at enhancing simplicity and efficiency across the regulatory landscape. This Report recommends the EBA launches a review of all the regulatory products it has developed (Level 2 and Level 3) since its establishment in relation to the Single Rulebook, starting with credit risk.&nbsp;As the credit risk area has accumulated a particularly large number of mandates under the EU Banking Package, the Discussion Paper examines how a systematic review of these mandates could be organised so that EBA&rsquo;s future work better supports efficiency and simplicity.</p>
<p>The Discussion Paper sets out concrete proposals to enhance the efficiency and simplicity of the credit risk framework within the remit of EBA&rsquo;s credit risk mandates. Because the framework must balance several key objectives, including risk‑sensitivity, comparability, and cost‑efficiency, assessing simplicity is inherently challenging. In addition to exploring potential policy simplifications, the paper also looks at improving the presentation of the framework by consolidating EBA products and aligning key regulatory definitions, thereby making the EBA&rsquo;s credit risk outputs more coherent and easier to navigate. It further highlights a number of challenges linked to specific mandates in the credit risk area and sets out measures to be applied in future mandated reports assessing the appropriateness of several elements laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "Send your comments" button on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/events/discussion-simplification-and-assessment-credit-risk-framework" title="Discussion on the simplification and assessment of the credit risk framework">consultation page</a>. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 10 May 2026. All contributions received will be published following the close of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The EBA published in December 2023 its roadmap on the implementation of the EU Banking Package.&nbsp; In the area of credit risk, the new mandates assigned to the EBA relate in many cases to existing EBA products developed and implemented upon previous CRD-CRR requirements. Hence, the implementation of these mandates provides an opportunity to update those products and ensure greater consistency and efficiency across the framework.</p>
<p>The 2025 EBA Report on the efficiency of the regulatory and supervisory framework includes as one of its recommendations to launch a comprehensive review of both the new flow of mandates (i.e. those not yet consulted on) and the existing stock (current products from the Single Rulebook). This Discussion Paper outlines how such a review should be carried out in the credit risk domain and proposes initial avenues to streamline and enhance the usability of the framework.</p>

<title>CFTC Targets Relationship Investment Scams With National And International Initiatives This Valentine’s Week</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-targets-relationship-investment-scams-with-national-and-international-initi-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-targets-relationship-investment-scams-with-national-and-international-initi-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As Valentine&rsquo;s Day approaches, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Office of Customer Education and Outreach is leading&nbsp;national and international awareness efforts to warn the public about relationship investment scams, a form of fraud that costs Americans an estimated $10 billion each year.</p>
<p>The national, interagency&nbsp;<em>DatingOrDefrauding?</em>&nbsp;social media awareness campaign warns Americans to be skeptical of any requests from new online friends or romantic interests. The campaign highlights a common warning sign: requests to send crypto assets, or other forms of payment, to invest in scams through fake crypto websites.</p>
<p>In addition to the CFTC, participating organizations include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Federal agencies: Department of Justice Criminal Division, Department of Labor Employee Benefits Security Administration, FBI, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation - Office of Inspector General, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, IRS Criminal Investigation, National Credit Union Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and U.S. Secret Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">State agencies:<span>&nbsp;Minnesota Department of Commerce, Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services, Virgin Islands Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s Office, Washington Department of Financial Institutions, and Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions.</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Non-governmental organizations:&nbsp;<span>FINRA, NFA, and North American Association of Securities Administrators.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Warning signs of relationship investment scams include an online friend or love interest who:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Is unable to meet in person.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Moves conversations off social or dating platforms to encrypted messaging apps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Claims to be, or know, an expert crypto trader.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p class="BulletedHyperlink">Offers to help the victim trade or invest money.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Foreign criminals are exploiting dating apps, social media, messaging platforms, and artificial intelligence to steal money from American citizens,&rdquo; CFTC Chairman Michael S. Selig said. &ldquo;Keep your friends and family safe by warning them about this scam and encouraging them to keep their crypto assets safe&nbsp;<span>by using trusted and secure software systems and U.S.-regulated intermediaries</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>OCEO is also collaborating with the International Organization of Securities Commissions on a global initiative to raise public awareness and reduce victimization from the scams. The Valentine&rsquo;s week campaign builds on a similar effort conducted in October 2025, when 16 jurisdictions across five continents carried out coordinated educational outreach.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Initiatives timed around Valentine&rsquo;s Day are particularly effective, as scammers often exploit emotional vulnerability and the desire for companionship. By providing the information needed to recognize and avoid relationship investment scams, the initiatives, which will run from Wednesday through Saturday, aim to reduce victimization and financial loss during a potentially high-risk period.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>About Relationship Investment Scams</strong></p>
<p>Relationship investment scams are a type of romance fraud. Often referred to by the perpetrators as &ldquo;pig butchering,&rdquo; these schemes rely on dating apps, social media platforms, messaging apps, and even random &ldquo;wrong number&rdquo; text messages to target potential victims. The scammers use fake profiles, images, videos, and voices to appear trustworthy, attractive, and professional. After establishing frequent contact and building emotional connections, they claim to earn significant profits trading crypto assets, precious metals, or foreign currency and offer to help victims do the same.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Victims are ultimately directed to fraudulent trading platforms controlled by organized criminal networks, resulting in substantial financial losses.</p>
<p>More information and resources about relationship investment scams are available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">CFTC.gov/LearnAndProtect</a>.</p>
<p><span><strong>About the Office of Customer Education and Outreach</strong></span></p>
<p><span>OCEO is responsible for helping people and potential customers spot, avoid, and report fraud. This requires the office to work closely with internal and external stakeholders to monitor and identify current and developing fraud trends, develop timely and effective educational materials, messages, and outreach strategies, and alert the public to products, situations, or behaviors that could make them targets for crime. The CFTC&rsquo;s full repository of customer education materials is available at&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect">CFTC.gov/LearnAndProtect</a><span>.</span></p>

<h5>Access to innovative exchange-traded products (ETPs) within a transparent, competitive and regulated framework, ensuring efficiency and investor protection</h5>

Building on our strong footprint and track record in crypto-linked assets, this new segment lays a solid foundation for further innovation and supports the growing demand for these assets in a transparent, competitive and regulated framework.&rdquo;</em></p>

<title>Volumes And Open Interest Rapidly Increasing On The EEX Nordic Power Derivatives Market</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/volumes-and-open-interest-rapidly-increasing-on-the-eex-nordic-power-derivatives-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/volumes-and-open-interest-rapidly-increasing-on-the-eex-nordic-power-derivatives-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The European Energy Exchange (EEX) is continuing the strong development in its Nordic power derivatives markets in all of the key indicators for growing a successful market. Volumes in terms of trades and orders in both the system price and zonal contracts are quickly gaining momentum. Market shares are increasing as well as the EEX open interest in the major system price and zonal contracts. Furthermore, the impressive increase in number of active traders has been warmly received by market participants.</p>
<p>In January 2026, a volume of 3.6 TWh was traded in the EEX Nordic Power Futures which has significant growth compared to the previous month and is even +8,162% year-on-year. Market share growth in both the system and zonal contracts has been impressive, which now stands at approximately 10% in months, 20% in quarters and up to 25% in yearly contracts. Standing out in January was the Sweden 3 zone, where the EEX reached almost 20% exchange market share, which is the largest zone by volume, with 1.5 TWh traded on EEX, marking an all-time high.</p>
<p>Liquidity on EEX has increased noticeably since the start of the comprehensive liquidity programmes, which started on 1 September 2025. From September 2025 to January 2026 a volume of 12.9 TWh has been traded, while the total 2025 volume amounted to 11.7 TWh.</p>
<p>The growth in volumes is also reflected by a dynamically increasing Open Interest which is up over 90% compared to last year. EEX has doubled its market open interest share over the last few months to 6% in the System Price Futures, based on exchange data published by ESMA. Open Interest (OI) rate is the total number of unsettled derivatives contracts in a given market, indicating the interest level and liquidity of this market.</p>
<p>The impressive growth in volumes, open interest and market shares in the system and zonal contracts is reflected in the number of active traders, both in terms of the number of trades and orders. Traders have started to notice that EEX&rsquo;s Nordic power offering is growing and this is attracting new participants. EEX has especially been successful in adding new international market participants which are trading Nordic power for the first time. Over the past five months the number of active participants has steadily increased, with a record participation of 45 in January 2026.</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see liquidity growing and we have good arguments for traders to use our products for hedging. We provide choice for customers by offering system price and zonal products, offering dedicated customer support with our offices in Stockholm and Oslo and bring our larger continental European and US-based market participant base to the Nordics. In close collaboration with both international and local trading participants, we look forward to continued liquidity growth throughout 2026.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>EEX&rsquo;s product offering for the region includes both Nordic System Price contracts, the so-called Zonal Futures with price determination for each Nordic delivery area, and Implied EPADs, a combination of Zonal Futures and the Nordic System Price Futures, which provide the benefit of the location spread effect. This setup reduces capital requirements through cross-margining effects.</p>

<title>UK VC Funding Activity Faces Challenges In 2025 With Contraction In Both Deal Volume And Value, Finds GlobalData</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The UK venture capital (VC) landscape faced a challenging environment in 2025, with dealmaking momentum slowing both in terms of volume and value compared to the previous year. The total number of VC deals announced in the country declined by around 17% in 2025 compared to 2024, while the corresponding funding value witnessed a year-on-year (YoY) decline of around 3%, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9nAw2i9NVNQPXGQip5nqGg3CtRFeWroc-2BgaLT7uNoevmgBBG2t9SWipjUkpf5vvgOFwTxmzHp0lxy8O85H4dALsaQobEfiowcL1jmrK5VNpfmvURobeTfOXfvlQai6Bp2GK1fh2Au6BODh4NDnIRAJZVSmfPgq3Np5kVcnHyEjCLFgRL-2FzH3pA1rzKt37GS66Q-3DjhZN_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYlZuSNUmUBt77HjIUAMkqEOPMgZk4uOTWzgjLfsxTqPlXnkF6tLNEebE1KbTirMIT6E5PlOg2SEpKs9w5Xd6-2Fj2BRCI7hOv15-2BcG8wVshjpZUhwXvsCvFja-2F82Lgk9jf54zvMz7vdBvcIYUO93DB62YusD97DqlWv6E4jg1wIdDVfD9HnkjjIRdY8R9Rkz7NywOqc1UVHnzo8Nv9ysEgpE8US61oNG-2FCZV0aiHvDbQg5I-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Compared with a 3% YoY decline in overall global deal volume and 31% growth in global value, the contraction indicates that the UK saw a sharper pullback than the broader market. Nevertheless, while the steeper decline in deal volume in the UK points to tighter diligence, the comparatively modest drop in value suggests investors are still backing promising companies, particularly those demonstrating clear routes to profitability and scalable unit economics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nexus Global Payments (NGP) appoints Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) and Network for Electronic Transfers Singapore (NETS) joint venture as the Nexus Technical Operator (NTO). This follows a competitive procurement process involving global bidders and marks a major milestone in building an interoperable global payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The evaluation of bidders considered technical capability, operational resilience, cost efficiency, and alignment with Nexus&rsquo; vision for global interoperability. PayNet and NETS joint venture emerged as the preferred partner due to the proven track record of the two leading ASEAN payment networks behind it and their commitment to innovation and collaboration.</p>
<p>The newly appointed NTO will work closely with leading global firms Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ &lsquo;AMZN&rsquo;) and Endava (NYSE &lsquo;DAVA&rsquo;) to deliver the technical design and development of the Nexus platform. Amazon Web Services is a global cloud technology leader that has made cloud computing and generative AI accessible to organisations of every size and industry whilst Endava leads the end-to-end design and engineering, applying its AI-native approach and deep industry expertise to build a resilient, future-ready solution. This global delivery capability and collaboration ensures that Nexus is built to meet international standards, scalable from inception and reflects best practices drawn from a wide range of payment system environments. The NTO will be responsible for building, operating, and maintaining the Nexus infrastructure, ensuring compliance with global standards, and delivering robust cybersecurity and operational resilience. It will also coordinate the onboarding of entities that are responsible for managing domestic instant payment schemes that will connect to Nexus to enable the banks and non-bank entities participating in these domestic systems to be part of the network.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our partnership with PayNet and NETS is a major milestone towards our vision for an interoperable global payments network. With our chosen partners&rsquo; proven expertise and commitment to innovation, we are confident that Nexus will be resilient, aligned with international standards from day one, and ready for future global scale. Nexus is shaping a future where cross-border payments are instant, accessible, and seamlessly connected.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Andrew McCormack, CEO, NGP</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Being selected as the Nexus Technical Operator alongside NETS is a significant honour for Malaysia. It reflects the trust in our domestic capabilities and our growing track record in enabling cross-border payments. Through DuitNow and our regional interoperability efforts, we&rsquo;ve shown what&rsquo;s possible and now we&rsquo;re ready to scale that impact globally through Nexus. We&rsquo;re proud to be part of this next chapter in building a more connected, inclusive, and seamless global payment ecosystem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Praveen Rajan, CEO, PayNet</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We are deeply honored to be selected as the Nexus Technical Operator, in partnership with PayNet. This appointment reflects a strong vote of confidence in our ability to build and operate payment infrastructure at scale and reinforces Singapore&rsquo;s pivotal role in advancing cross-border payment innovation. The NETS Group was involved in establishing the first bilateral cross-border linkage between Singapore and Thailand for account-to-account transfers in 2021 and we are excited to bring this spirit of innovation to enable seamless cross-border payments through a 'network-to-network' ecosystem. We look forward to advancing the vision of borderless payments, working collaboratively towards a modern, real-time international payment network infrastructure.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Lawrence Chan, Group CEO, NETS</i></b></p>
<p>PayNet is Malaysia&rsquo;s national payments network and shared infrastructure provider, operating services such as DuitNow Transfer and DuitNow QR. It plays a central role in modernising and innovating Malaysia&rsquo;s digital payment agenda. NETS is Singapore&rsquo;s leading payment solutions provider, backed by over forty years of experience in delivering secure, efficient payment systems in Singapore and expanding in recent years to offer regional connectivity. The joint venture combines PayNet&rsquo;s domestic expertise and NETS&rsquo; technical capabilities to deliver a world-class platform for Nexus. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to innovation and financial inclusion across Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>The selection of the NTO represents pivotal progress toward Nexus&rsquo;s first live deployment across its initial cohort of countries. With technical development scheduled to begin in early 2026 and go-live targeted for 2027, this trajectory reflects NGP&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to delivering a sustainable, scalable, and globally interoperable solution&mdash;one that redefines speed, transparency, and accessibility in international transactions.</p>
<p>Nexus simplifies cross-border payments by connecting domestic real-time payment systems. It reduces reliance on intermediaries, cuts costs, and enables users to send and receive money internationally within seconds, through familiar banking or payment apps.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Early-January Rate Decline Unlocks Refinance Opportunity For Nearly 5 Million Homeowners - Affordability Reaches Four-Year High But Remains Structurally Stretched As Home Price-To-Income Ratios Remain Elevated</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-early-january-rate-decline-unlocks-refinance-opportunity-f-202629/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its February 2026 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. According to the analysis, early January declines in mortgage rates unlocked refinance opportunities for nearly five million borrowers and helped push affordability to a four-year high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even small reductions toward 6% rates can significantly boost affordability, particularly for homeowners who could refinance into a lower rate and monthly payments,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;When rates hit 6.04% on January 9, the number of homeowners in the money to refinance jumped by 20% and affordability hit its best level in four years. That said, affordability remains structurally challenged, with home prices still elevated relative to incomes and meaningful differences emerging across regions and borrower segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the February Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Refinance incentives surged to a nearly four-year high following early-January interest rate declines<br /><br /></span>On January 9, interest rates reached 6.04%, according to the ICE 30-year conforming fixed rate index&nbsp;<span>,</span>&nbsp;which put roughly 4.8 million borrowers &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; for a refinance &mdash; the highest level since early 2022. That drop effectively increased the eligible population by 20% overnight. Although some of that benefit has since receded, the episode underscores how sensitive the market is to rate shifts in the high‑5% to low‑6% range. Nearly 1.3 million recently originated mortgages carry rates between 6.875% and 6.99%, including more than half a million from 2025, making it the most common rate band last year, and the most sensitive to interest rate drops.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Housing affordability reached its best level since early 2022, but remains stretched by historical standards<br /><br /></span>In early January, the monthly principal and interest payment needed to purchase the average-priced home fell by -$164 (-7%) year over year to $2,091, reducing the share of median household income required to 27.8%. Despite the improvement, the national home price-to-income ratio remains elevated at roughly 4.8:1, well above its long-run average near 4:1. To revert back to pre-pandemic home price-to-income ratios, household incomes would need to rise a little over 15%, assuming home prices remain flat.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Negative equity is increasing modestly, concentrated in recent vintages and select Southern markets<br /><br /></span>More than 1.1 million borrowers ended 2025 underwater &mdash; the highest level since early 2018 &mdash; with negative equity heavily concentrated among FHA and VA loans originated in 2022 or later. Several Southern markets now have more than one in 10 mortgaged homes underwater, even as national equity levels remain historically strong.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home price growth slowed to its weakest pace in more than a decade, with regional divergence widening<br /><br /></span>U.S. home prices rose just 0.6% in 2025, marking the smallest calendar year growth since 2011. The Northeast and Midwest continue to provide stability, while price declines in the South and West are increasingly weighing on national averages.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s market is full of cross‑currents &mdash; borrowers responding quickly to rate shifts, affordability improving for some but not others, and pockets of rising credit stress,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our end-to-end mortgage platform helps servicers and lenders make sense of those moving parts and act on opportunity. It gives them a clearer view of who might benefit from refinancing, where portfolio risks are building, and how to engage customers with the right options at the right time &mdash; all while supporting timely follow-through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full February Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of payment performance trends, and housing market trends featuring ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>

<p>IOSCO published today it&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD813.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608243551%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=Xe97tmeZh%2BP%2FTUCDALhxas5DitEfFMEItk2f2nfveEw%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2026 Work Program</a>.</p>
<p>Building on its 2025 Work Program, IOSCO will keep its focus on strengthening capital markets. IOSCO&rsquo;s key strategic priorities for 2026 are:&nbsp;<strong>(i) Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness, (ii) Protecting investors, (iii) The evolution of Public and Private Markets; (iv) Technological transformation,</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>(v) Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness</strong>.</p>
<p>While the work programme showcases IOSCO&rsquo;s initiatives, IOSCO remains committed to&nbsp;<strong>close collaboration</strong>&nbsp;with other international organizations and standard setters such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to address emerging risks and shared global challenges, promote greater alignment in regulatory approaches, and support initiatives related to&nbsp;<strong>capital markets development</strong>.</p>
<p>Overview of IOSCO's 2026 Work Program</p>
<p><strong>1. Strengthening Financial Resilience and Market Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Ensuring the resilience of the global financial system remains a key pillar of IOSCO&rsquo;s mandate. IOSCO will finalize several ongoing work streams, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its review of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.iosco.org%2Flibrary%2Fpubdocs%2Fpdf%2FIOSCOPD811.pdf&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cmailing-lists%40iosco.org%7C30c1ea71a5ff4157f65208de67bdb30f%7Cbcc6c66cdb3b48328af2cc363a097444%7C0%7C0%7C639062261608267634%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=ifWdOBLM87WQR82E%2B3FrsG0nmdGKa%2BGzKhaMc8RArS8%3D&amp;reserved=0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">IOSCO Principles for the Valuation of Collective Investment Schemes.</a></li>

</ul>
<p>New key initiatives in this field for 2026 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking to address issues related to over-the-counter&nbsp;<strong>(OTC) derivatives</strong>&nbsp;reporting fragmentation.</li>
<li>Work on the impact of market microstructures on liquidity and of&nbsp;<strong>extended trading hours</strong>&nbsp;on equity trading venues.</li>
<li>Contributing to FSB&rsquo;s work on issues of&nbsp;<strong>non-bank data</strong>&nbsp;availability, use and quality.</li>
<li>Contributing, as necessary, to follow-up work on the issue of&nbsp;<strong>leverage in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>IOSCO will continue to develop work to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen the operational resilience of Financial Market Infrastructures</strong>&nbsp;(FMIs) through the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO Operational Resilience Group. This work both considers whether there are gaps in the effectiveness of FMIs&rsquo; management of third-party risks and how to address potential gaps in FMI&rsquo;s cyber resilience.</p>
<p><strong>2. Protecting Investors</strong></p>
<p>IOSCO will further strengthen its efforts in investor education by launching its first&nbsp;<strong>TechSprint</strong>, in partnership with the UK Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s AI Lab. This initiative aims to leverage technology to develop educational resources that empower retail investors to navigate the novel products available to them, understand the risks and opportunities associated, and identify scams.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also explore these&nbsp;<strong>novel products</strong>, such as crypto-asset funds, private credit vehicles and retail-facing derivatives, which offer greater choice to investors but may also introduce new risks.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to engage with platform providers such as social media companies, search engines and internet providers to advocate for the restriction and monitoring of harmful or fraudulent content, and to promote the use of&nbsp;<strong>I-SCAN</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; its Enhanced Investor Alerts Portal. This new system offers a global real-time database of supervisory alerts on unauthorised firms and known scams to improve the protection of clients and investors and fight financial fraud.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Evolution of Public and Private Markets</strong></p>
<p>Capital markets are evolving, with a significant decline in public debt and equity issuance, and a rise in trading fragmentation and growth in private markets, introducing new complexities.</p>
<p>Key initiatives in this field include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exploration of the growing interconnectedness between&nbsp;<strong>private equity</strong>&nbsp;activities and the&nbsp;<strong>audit sector</strong>.</li>
<li>Contribution to the FSB&rsquo;s deep dive on&nbsp;<strong>private credit</strong>.</li>
<li>Research work on the functioning of&nbsp;<strong>public markets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Technological transformation</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, the intersection of digital assets with traditional finance and the rise of&nbsp;<strong>tokenization</strong>&nbsp;all present significant opportunities for financial markets and their investors but they can also present risks.</p>
<p>In 2026, IOSCO will advance its&nbsp;<strong>crypto-asset roadmap</strong>&nbsp;by finalizing a formal methodology for crypto and digital assets assessments, initiate regular thematic reviews, and continue to monitor developments arising from financial technology adoption.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also develop&nbsp;<strong>a supervisory tool kit on AI</strong>&nbsp;and guidance for firms on disclosures and governance in relation to AI and will focus on Supervisory Technology (<strong>SupTech</strong>), after the recent creation of a dedicated collaborative forum for members to share knowledge on how technology and in particular AI-powered tools can boost the efficiency of supervision and enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Promoting Regulatory Cooperation and Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness remains a key strategic priority of IOSCO. A key priority will be to assist members from emerging markets to build sound and robust capital markets, through&nbsp;<strong>enhanced capacity building</strong>, strengthened partnerships with international financial institutions, and direct assistance in addressing identified challenges.</p>
<p>Regulatory cooperation remains central to the effective delivery of these priorities. In particular, the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), with 131 signatories, is the&nbsp;<strong>global gold standard</strong>&nbsp;for international enforcement cooperation for financial markets.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to support MMoU signatories, including by encouraging them to upgrade to the Enhanced MMoU (EMMoU) and by conducting training and reviews. IOSCO will also continue to support non-signatories in meeting the requirements for adoption, ensuring that the global safety net against misconduct remains tight.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue its&nbsp;<strong>regular reviews</strong>, promoting the consistent application of securities regulation worldwide.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also continue to deliver tailored capacity-building initiatives as part of the NEXTGEN program. In that context, a new dedicated&nbsp;<strong>e-learning platform</strong>&nbsp;will be developed during 2026 to expand the reach and value of this key part of IOSCO&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<title>Comment From Hina Sattar Joshi, Director At TP ICAP, Digital Assets - - Bitcoin 'Boom And Bust' Pattern</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Market sentiment</b></p>
<p>The recent sharp swings in crypto prices underscore how the market&rsquo;s infrastructure is still evolving and its impact on volatility. Sentiment is currently very fragile, with investors anchoring themselves to the traditional four-year&nbsp;Bitcoin cycle, in which Bitcoin&rsquo;s price historically follows a recurring pattern of &lsquo;boom and bust&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen over the past couple of weeks BTC ETFs experiencing significant outflows, while Ethereum and XRP products have attracted notable inflows. This trend points to a rotation in risk appetite, rather than a mass exit from the asset class.</p>
<p><b>Policy and market structure</b></p>
<p>Structural forces continue to steer institutional appetite for digital assets.&nbsp; Sentiment toward the recently announced collaboration between the SEC and CFTC on &lsquo;Project Crypto&rsquo;, aiming to unify US regulation, was muted compared to the enthusiasm compared to recent policy milestones like the GENIUS Act. This reaction reflects&nbsp;already fragile market sentiment, combined with concerns that the initiative risks a complex, dual-layered regulatory framework that could stifle growth.</p>
<p>Turning to the UK and Europe, we&rsquo;re seeing cleaner digital asset frameworks being established, as regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty and enables greater institutional participation. Looking at the UK specifically, the HM Treasury&rsquo;s DIGIT (Digital Gilt Instrument) programme, which will issue short-dated native gilts on blockchain infrastructure, marks a meaningful step towards modernising capital markets and is drawing significant interest as engagement shifts from exploratory to operational.</p>
<p>Progressive policies and greater conviction from policymakers outside of the US raise the question of whether USD-backed stablecoins will remain the dominant use case, or whether other stablecoins will&nbsp;be able to capture market share.</p>

<p>Japanese stocks soared to record highs as bonds weakened and the yen hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a decisive victory in Sunday&rsquo;s snap election.</p>
<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) captured 316 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, granting her the mandate to advance her ambitious spending plans and tax relief initiatives without needing to negotiate with opposition parties. The LDP&rsquo;s supermajority also enables the government to pass legislation without requiring approval from the upper house.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 surged 5.7% to an unprecedented 57,337.07 by 0146 GMT, with 197 of its 225 components gaining. The broader Topix index climbed 3.4% to a record-breaking 3,825.67, reflecting widespread market optimism over the election results.</p>

<title>ASIC Action Sees FIIG Securities Ordered To Pay $2.5 Million Over Cyber Security Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Australian&nbsp;fixed-income&nbsp;specialist,&nbsp;FIIG Securities Limited (<strong>FIIG</strong>), has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in pecuniary penalties after ASIC brought a case against the firm for failures to protect thousands of clients from cyber security threats for more than four years.</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s failures worsened a 2023 cyber-attack which saw around 385 gigabytes of confidential information stolen and highly sensitive client data leaked onto the dark web &ndash; including driver&rsquo;s licences, passport information, bank account details and tax file numbers.</p>
<p>FIIG notified some 18,000 clients that their personal information may have been compromised.</p>
<p>FIIG admitted that it failed to comply with its Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence obligations and that adequate cyber security measures &ndash; suited to a firm of its size and the sensitivity of client data held &ndash; would have enabled it to detect and respond to the data breach sooner. It also admitted that complying with its own policies and procedures could have supported earlier detection and prevented some or all of the client information from being downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Court today ordered FIIG to pay a $2.5 million penalty and pay $500,000 towards ASIC&rsquo;s costs. The Court also ordered FIIG to undertake a compliance programme involving the engagement of an independent expert to ensure its cyber security and cyber resilience systems are reasonably managed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Chair&nbsp;Sarah Court&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&lsquo;Cyber-attacks&nbsp;and&nbsp;data breaches&nbsp;are&nbsp;escalating&nbsp;in both scale and sophistication,&nbsp;and inadequate&nbsp;controls&nbsp;put&nbsp;clients and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;at real risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC expects financial services licensees to be on the front foot every day to protect their clients. FIIG wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; and they put thousands of clients at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this&nbsp;case,&nbsp;the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;far exceeded&nbsp;what it would have cost&nbsp;FIIG&nbsp;to implement&nbsp;adequate controls&nbsp;in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the first time the Federal Court has imposed civil penalties for cyber security failures under the general AFS licensee obligations, setting a clear licence-to-operate expectation for robust cyber resilience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clients entrust licensees with sensitive and confidential information, and that trust carries clear responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;failures between 13 March 2019 to 8 June 2023 included&nbsp;examples where it&nbsp;did not:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate the necessary financial resources to have suitably qualified and experienced people available, or implement adequate technological resources to manage cyber security</li>
<li>implement adequate cyber security measures, including multi-factor authentication for remote access users, strong passwords and access controls for privileged accounts, appropriate configuration of firewalls and security software, regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning</li>
<li>have a structured plan to ensure key software systems were being updated to address security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>have qualified IT personnel monitoring threat alerts to identify and respond to cyber-attacks</li>
<li>provide mandatory cyber security awareness training to staff, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>have an appropriate cyber incident response plan that was tested at least annually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Entities that fail to maintain proper cyber security controls risk regulatory action by ASIC and exposure to malicious exploitation,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>ASIC expects AFS licensees to prioritise cyber-resilience and invest in people, systems and governance which are fit-for-purpose for entity size and the sensitivity of client information held.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>FIIG provides retail and wholesale investors with access to fixed income investments and bond financing. As an AFS licensee, FIIG plays an important role in providing custodial and trading services, maintaining records of client investments, and holding funds and fixed income investments on behalf of its clients. At the time of non-compliance, FIIG held approximately $3 billion in client assets under management.</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;identified&nbsp;cyber-attacks, data breaches and/or inadequate operational resilience and crisis management within its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/key-issues-outlook-2026/" title="Key issues outlook 2026">2026 key issues outlook</a>, and expects AFS licensees to prioritise and invest in systems that protect their customers and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;integrity in the financial system.</p>
<p>This case was ASIC&rsquo;s second cyber security enforcement action. In May 2022, the Federal Court ruled AFS licensee, RI Advice, had breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly when it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;have adequate risk management systems to manage its cyber security risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-104mr-court-finds-ri-advice-failed-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="22-104MR Court finds RI Advice failed to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">22-104MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC filed civil proceedings against financial advice business Fortnum Private Wealth Limited in July 2025, alleging it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;properly manage&nbsp;and mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-143mr-asic-sues-fortnum-private-wealth-for-allegedly-failing-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="25-143MR ASIC sues Fortnum Private Wealth for allegedly failing to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">25-143MR</a>).</p>
<p>FIIG has admitted it failed to comply with its AFS licence obligations by:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to take all necessary steps to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, including by not having adequate measures in place to protect clients from the risks and consequences of a cyber incident</li>
<li>failing to&nbsp;have&nbsp;available adequate&nbsp;financial,&nbsp;technological&nbsp;and human resources to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;its obligations and&nbsp;support adequate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;measures, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>failing to have&nbsp;an adequate risk management system&nbsp;manage or&nbsp;mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks to FIIG and its clients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
