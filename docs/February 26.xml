<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The UK venture capital (VC) landscape faced a challenging environment in 2025, with dealmaking momentum slowing both in terms of volume and value compared to the previous year. The total number of VC deals announced in the country declined by around 17% in 2025 compared to 2024, while the corresponding funding value witnessed a year-on-year (YoY) decline of around 3%, according to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=u001.gqh-2BaxUzlo7XKIuSly0rC502qyvSaH8suunkkct0v9nAw2i9NVNQPXGQip5nqGg3CtRFeWroc-2BgaLT7uNoevmgBBG2t9SWipjUkpf5vvgOFwTxmzHp0lxy8O85H4dALsaQobEfiowcL1jmrK5VNpfmvURobeTfOXfvlQai6Bp2GK1fh2Au6BODh4NDnIRAJZVSmfPgq3Np5kVcnHyEjCLFgRL-2FzH3pA1rzKt37GS66Q-3DjhZN_awSuR00uK8EZood8su7v4ItMFr0d7S5MNR1CcvAHRb7u8JiSB5Axp3o6-2Brp7TTn9jFAQeaiwuDUNp6ED3yPnAqPtLtA7N0aAz15yM-2Fa7YbLjEsQ0GRAa40BulYCiuXYlZuSNUmUBt77HjIUAMkqEOPMgZk4uOTWzgjLfsxTqPlXnkF6tLNEebE1KbTirMIT6E5PlOg2SEpKs9w5Xd6-2Fj2BRCI7hOv15-2BcG8wVshjpZUhwXvsCvFja-2F82Lgk9jf54zvMz7vdBvcIYUO93DB62YusD97DqlWv6E4jg1wIdDVfD9HnkjjIRdY8R9Rkz7NywOqc1UVHnzo8Nv9ysEgpE8US61oNG-2FCZV0aiHvDbQg5I-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">GlobalData</span></span></span></a><span>, a leading intelligence and productivity platform.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Compared with a 3% YoY decline in overall global deal volume and 31% growth in global value, the contraction indicates that the UK saw a sharper pullback than the broader market. Nevertheless, while the steeper decline in deal volume in the UK points to tighter diligence, the comparatively modest drop in value suggests investors are still backing promising companies, particularly those demonstrating clear routes to profitability and scalable unit economics.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some of the notable VC funding rounds announced in the UK in 2025 include $1.1 billion secured by Nscale, $600 million raised by Isomorphic Labs, $500 million secured by Rapyd, $411 million secured by Verdiva Bio, and $350 million secured by PS Miner, among others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Bose adds:&nbsp;</strong>&ldquo;Despite the setback, the UK continues to remain among the top five markets for VC funding activity globally in terms of both deal volume and value.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nexus Global Payments (NGP) appoints Payments Network Malaysia (PayNet) and Network for Electronic Transfers Singapore (NETS) joint venture as the Nexus Technical Operator (NTO). This follows a competitive procurement process involving global bidders and marks a major milestone in building an interoperable global payments infrastructure.</p>
<p>The evaluation of bidders considered technical capability, operational resilience, cost efficiency, and alignment with Nexus&rsquo; vision for global interoperability. PayNet and NETS joint venture emerged as the preferred partner due to the proven track record of the two leading ASEAN payment networks behind it and their commitment to innovation and collaboration.</p>
<p>The newly appointed NTO will work closely with leading global firms Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ &lsquo;AMZN&rsquo;) and Endava (NYSE &lsquo;DAVA&rsquo;) to deliver the technical design and development of the Nexus platform. Amazon Web Services is a global cloud technology leader that has made cloud computing and generative AI accessible to organisations of every size and industry whilst Endava leads the end-to-end design and engineering, applying its AI-native approach and deep industry expertise to build a resilient, future-ready solution. This global delivery capability and collaboration ensures that Nexus is built to meet international standards, scalable from inception and reflects best practices drawn from a wide range of payment system environments. The NTO will be responsible for building, operating, and maintaining the Nexus infrastructure, ensuring compliance with global standards, and delivering robust cybersecurity and operational resilience. It will also coordinate the onboarding of entities that are responsible for managing domestic instant payment schemes that will connect to Nexus to enable the banks and non-bank entities participating in these domestic systems to be part of the network.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Our partnership with PayNet and NETS is a major milestone towards our vision for an interoperable global payments network. With our chosen partners&rsquo; proven expertise and commitment to innovation, we are confident that Nexus will be resilient, aligned with international standards from day one, and ready for future global scale. Nexus is shaping a future where cross-border payments are instant, accessible, and seamlessly connected.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Andrew McCormack, CEO, NGP</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Being selected as the Nexus Technical Operator alongside NETS is a significant honour for Malaysia. It reflects the trust in our domestic capabilities and our growing track record in enabling cross-border payments. Through DuitNow and our regional interoperability efforts, we&rsquo;ve shown what&rsquo;s possible and now we&rsquo;re ready to scale that impact globally through Nexus. We&rsquo;re proud to be part of this next chapter in building a more connected, inclusive, and seamless global payment ecosystem.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Praveen Rajan, CEO, PayNet</i></b></p>
<p><i>&ldquo;We are deeply honored to be selected as the Nexus Technical Operator, in partnership with PayNet. This appointment reflects a strong vote of confidence in our ability to build and operate payment infrastructure at scale and reinforces Singapore&rsquo;s pivotal role in advancing cross-border payment innovation. The NETS Group was involved in establishing the first bilateral cross-border linkage between Singapore and Thailand for account-to-account transfers in 2021 and we are excited to bring this spirit of innovation to enable seamless cross-border payments through a 'network-to-network' ecosystem. We look forward to advancing the vision of borderless payments, working collaboratively towards a modern, real-time international payment network infrastructure.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p><b><i>- Lawrence Chan, Group CEO, NETS</i></b></p>
<p>PayNet is Malaysia&rsquo;s national payments network and shared infrastructure provider, operating services such as DuitNow Transfer and DuitNow QR. It plays a central role in modernising and innovating Malaysia&rsquo;s digital payment agenda. NETS is Singapore&rsquo;s leading payment solutions provider, backed by over forty years of experience in delivering secure, efficient payment systems in Singapore and expanding in recent years to offer regional connectivity. The joint venture combines PayNet&rsquo;s domestic expertise and NETS&rsquo; technical capabilities to deliver a world-class platform for Nexus. This partnership reflects a shared commitment to innovation and financial inclusion across Asia and beyond.</p>
<p>The selection of the NTO represents pivotal progress toward Nexus&rsquo;s first live deployment across its initial cohort of countries. With technical development scheduled to begin in early 2026 and go-live targeted for 2027, this trajectory reflects NGP&rsquo;s unwavering commitment to delivering a sustainable, scalable, and globally interoperable solution&mdash;one that redefines speed, transparency, and accessibility in international transactions.</p>
<p>Nexus simplifies cross-border payments by connecting domestic real-time payment systems. It reduces reliance on intermediaries, cuts costs, and enables users to send and receive money internationally within seconds, through familiar banking or payment apps.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Early-January Rate Decline Unlocks Refinance Opportunity For Nearly 5 Million Homeowners - Affordability Reaches Four-Year High But Remains Structurally Stretched As Home Price-To-Income Ratios Remain Elevated</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today released its February 2026 ICE Mortgage Monitor Report. According to the analysis, early January declines in mortgage rates unlocked refinance opportunities for nearly five million borrowers and helped push affordability to a four-year high.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even small reductions toward 6% rates can significantly boost affordability, particularly for homeowners who could refinance into a lower rate and monthly payments,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;When rates hit 6.04% on January 9, the number of homeowners in the money to refinance jumped by 20% and affordability hit its best level in four years. That said, affordability remains structurally challenged, with home prices still elevated relative to incomes and meaningful differences emerging across regions and borrower segments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings from the February Mortgage Monitor include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Refinance incentives surged to a nearly four-year high following early-January interest rate declines<br /><br /></span>On January 9, interest rates reached 6.04%, according to the ICE 30-year conforming fixed rate index&nbsp;<span>,</span>&nbsp;which put roughly 4.8 million borrowers &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; for a refinance &mdash; the highest level since early 2022. That drop effectively increased the eligible population by 20% overnight. Although some of that benefit has since receded, the episode underscores how sensitive the market is to rate shifts in the high‑5% to low‑6% range. Nearly 1.3 million recently originated mortgages carry rates between 6.875% and 6.99%, including more than half a million from 2025, making it the most common rate band last year, and the most sensitive to interest rate drops.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Housing affordability reached its best level since early 2022, but remains stretched by historical standards<br /><br /></span>In early January, the monthly principal and interest payment needed to purchase the average-priced home fell by -$164 (-7%) year over year to $2,091, reducing the share of median household income required to 27.8%. Despite the improvement, the national home price-to-income ratio remains elevated at roughly 4.8:1, well above its long-run average near 4:1. To revert back to pre-pandemic home price-to-income ratios, household incomes would need to rise a little over 15%, assuming home prices remain flat.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Negative equity is increasing modestly, concentrated in recent vintages and select Southern markets<br /><br /></span>More than 1.1 million borrowers ended 2025 underwater &mdash; the highest level since early 2018 &mdash; with negative equity heavily concentrated among FHA and VA loans originated in 2022 or later. Several Southern markets now have more than one in 10 mortgaged homes underwater, even as national equity levels remain historically strong.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Home price growth slowed to its weakest pace in more than a decade, with regional divergence widening<br /><br /></span>U.S. home prices rose just 0.6% in 2025, marking the smallest calendar year growth since 2011. The Northeast and Midwest continue to provide stability, while price declines in the South and West are increasingly weighing on national averages.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s market is full of cross‑currents &mdash; borrowers responding quickly to rate shifts, affordability improving for some but not others, and pockets of rising credit stress,&rdquo; said Bob Hart, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;Our end-to-end mortgage platform helps servicers and lenders make sense of those moving parts and act on opportunity. It gives them a clearer view of who might benefit from refinancing, where portfolio risks are building, and how to engage customers with the right options at the right time &mdash; all while supporting timely follow-through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full February Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of payment performance trends, and housing market trends featuring ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data.</p>

</ul>
<p>New key initiatives in this field for 2026 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking to address issues related to over-the-counter&nbsp;<strong>(OTC) derivatives</strong>&nbsp;reporting fragmentation.</li>
<li>Work on the impact of market microstructures on liquidity and of&nbsp;<strong>extended trading hours</strong>&nbsp;on equity trading venues.</li>
<li>Contributing to FSB&rsquo;s work on issues of&nbsp;<strong>non-bank data</strong>&nbsp;availability, use and quality.</li>
<li>Contributing, as necessary, to follow-up work on the issue of&nbsp;<strong>leverage in non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>IOSCO will continue to develop work to&nbsp;<strong>strengthen the operational resilience of Financial Market Infrastructures</strong>&nbsp;(FMIs) through the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)-IOSCO Operational Resilience Group. This work both considers whether there are gaps in the effectiveness of FMIs&rsquo; management of third-party risks and how to address potential gaps in FMI&rsquo;s cyber resilience.</p>
<p><strong>2. Protecting Investors</strong></p>
<p>IOSCO will further strengthen its efforts in investor education by launching its first&nbsp;<strong>TechSprint</strong>, in partnership with the UK Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s AI Lab. This initiative aims to leverage technology to develop educational resources that empower retail investors to navigate the novel products available to them, understand the risks and opportunities associated, and identify scams.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also explore these&nbsp;<strong>novel products</strong>, such as crypto-asset funds, private credit vehicles and retail-facing derivatives, which offer greater choice to investors but may also introduce new risks.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to engage with platform providers such as social media companies, search engines and internet providers to advocate for the restriction and monitoring of harmful or fraudulent content, and to promote the use of&nbsp;<strong>I-SCAN</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; its Enhanced Investor Alerts Portal. This new system offers a global real-time database of supervisory alerts on unauthorised firms and known scams to improve the protection of clients and investors and fight financial fraud.</p>
<p><strong>3. The Evolution of Public and Private Markets</strong></p>
<p>Capital markets are evolving, with a significant decline in public debt and equity issuance, and a rise in trading fragmentation and growth in private markets, introducing new complexities.</p>
<p>Key initiatives in this field include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An exploration of the growing interconnectedness between&nbsp;<strong>private equity</strong>&nbsp;activities and the&nbsp;<strong>audit sector</strong>.</li>
<li>Contribution to the FSB&rsquo;s deep dive on&nbsp;<strong>private credit</strong>.</li>
<li>Research work on the functioning of&nbsp;<strong>public markets</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Technological transformation</strong></p>
<p>The adoption of&nbsp;<strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>, the intersection of digital assets with traditional finance and the rise of&nbsp;<strong>tokenization</strong>&nbsp;all present significant opportunities for financial markets and their investors but they can also present risks.</p>
<p>In 2026, IOSCO will advance its&nbsp;<strong>crypto-asset roadmap</strong>&nbsp;by finalizing a formal methodology for crypto and digital assets assessments, initiate regular thematic reviews, and continue to monitor developments arising from financial technology adoption.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also develop&nbsp;<strong>a supervisory tool kit on AI</strong>&nbsp;and guidance for firms on disclosures and governance in relation to AI and will focus on Supervisory Technology (<strong>SupTech</strong>), after the recent creation of a dedicated collaborative forum for members to share knowledge on how technology and in particular AI-powered tools can boost the efficiency of supervision and enforcement.</p>
<p><strong>5. Promoting Regulatory Cooperation and Effectiveness</strong></p>
<p>Promoting regulatory cooperation and effectiveness remains a key strategic priority of IOSCO. A key priority will be to assist members from emerging markets to build sound and robust capital markets, through&nbsp;<strong>enhanced capacity building</strong>, strengthened partnerships with international financial institutions, and direct assistance in addressing identified challenges.</p>
<p>Regulatory cooperation remains central to the effective delivery of these priorities. In particular, the IOSCO Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU), with 131 signatories, is the&nbsp;<strong>global gold standard</strong>&nbsp;for international enforcement cooperation for financial markets.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue to support MMoU signatories, including by encouraging them to upgrade to the Enhanced MMoU (EMMoU) and by conducting training and reviews. IOSCO will also continue to support non-signatories in meeting the requirements for adoption, ensuring that the global safety net against misconduct remains tight.</p>
<p>IOSCO will continue its&nbsp;<strong>regular reviews</strong>, promoting the consistent application of securities regulation worldwide.</p>
<p>IOSCO will also continue to deliver tailored capacity-building initiatives as part of the NEXTGEN program. In that context, a new dedicated&nbsp;<strong>e-learning platform</strong>&nbsp;will be developed during 2026 to expand the reach and value of this key part of IOSCO&rsquo;s mission.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Market sentiment</b></p>
<p>The recent sharp swings in crypto prices underscore how the market&rsquo;s infrastructure is still evolving and its impact on volatility. Sentiment is currently very fragile, with investors anchoring themselves to the traditional four-year&nbsp;Bitcoin cycle, in which Bitcoin&rsquo;s price historically follows a recurring pattern of &lsquo;boom and bust&rsquo;. We&rsquo;ve seen over the past couple of weeks BTC ETFs experiencing significant outflows, while Ethereum and XRP products have attracted notable inflows. This trend points to a rotation in risk appetite, rather than a mass exit from the asset class.</p>
<p><b>Policy and market structure</b></p>
<p>Structural forces continue to steer institutional appetite for digital assets.&nbsp; Sentiment toward the recently announced collaboration between the SEC and CFTC on &lsquo;Project Crypto&rsquo;, aiming to unify US regulation, was muted compared to the enthusiasm compared to recent policy milestones like the GENIUS Act. This reaction reflects&nbsp;already fragile market sentiment, combined with concerns that the initiative risks a complex, dual-layered regulatory framework that could stifle growth.</p>
<p>Turning to the UK and Europe, we&rsquo;re seeing cleaner digital asset frameworks being established, as regulatory alignment reduces uncertainty and enables greater institutional participation. Looking at the UK specifically, the HM Treasury&rsquo;s DIGIT (Digital Gilt Instrument) programme, which will issue short-dated native gilts on blockchain infrastructure, marks a meaningful step towards modernising capital markets and is drawing significant interest as engagement shifts from exploratory to operational.</p>
<p>Progressive policies and greater conviction from policymakers outside of the US raise the question of whether USD-backed stablecoins will remain the dominant use case, or whether other stablecoins will&nbsp;be able to capture market share.</p>

<p>Japanese stocks soared to record highs as bonds weakened and the yen hit an all-time low against the Swiss franc after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi secured a decisive victory in Sunday&rsquo;s snap election.</p>
<p>Takaichi&rsquo;s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) captured 316 of the 465 seats in the lower house of parliament, granting her the mandate to advance her ambitious spending plans and tax relief initiatives without needing to negotiate with opposition parties. The LDP&rsquo;s supermajority also enables the government to pass legislation without requiring approval from the upper house.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 surged 5.7% to an unprecedented 57,337.07 by 0146 GMT, with 197 of its 225 components gaining. The broader Topix index climbed 3.4% to a record-breaking 3,825.67, reflecting widespread market optimism over the election results.</p>

<title>ASIC Action Sees FIIG Securities Ordered To Pay $2.5 Million Over Cyber Security Failures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Australian&nbsp;fixed-income&nbsp;specialist,&nbsp;FIIG Securities Limited (<strong>FIIG</strong>), has been ordered to pay $2.5 million in pecuniary penalties after ASIC brought a case against the firm for failures to protect thousands of clients from cyber security threats for more than four years.</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s failures worsened a 2023 cyber-attack which saw around 385 gigabytes of confidential information stolen and highly sensitive client data leaked onto the dark web &ndash; including driver&rsquo;s licences, passport information, bank account details and tax file numbers.</p>
<p>FIIG notified some 18,000 clients that their personal information may have been compromised.</p>
<p>FIIG admitted that it failed to comply with its Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence obligations and that adequate cyber security measures &ndash; suited to a firm of its size and the sensitivity of client data held &ndash; would have enabled it to detect and respond to the data breach sooner. It also admitted that complying with its own policies and procedures could have supported earlier detection and prevented some or all of the client information from being downloaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Federal Court today ordered FIIG to pay a $2.5 million penalty and pay $500,000 towards ASIC&rsquo;s costs. The Court also ordered FIIG to undertake a compliance programme involving the engagement of an independent expert to ensure its cyber security and cyber resilience systems are reasonably managed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;Deputy&nbsp;Chair&nbsp;Sarah Court&nbsp;said,&nbsp;&lsquo;Cyber-attacks&nbsp;and&nbsp;data breaches&nbsp;are&nbsp;escalating&nbsp;in both scale and sophistication,&nbsp;and inadequate&nbsp;controls&nbsp;put&nbsp;clients and&nbsp;companies&nbsp;at real risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;ASIC expects financial services licensees to be on the front foot every day to protect their clients. FIIG wasn&rsquo;t &ndash; and they put thousands of clients at risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;In this&nbsp;case,&nbsp;the&nbsp;consequences&nbsp;far exceeded&nbsp;what it would have cost&nbsp;FIIG&nbsp;to implement&nbsp;adequate controls&nbsp;in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the first time the Federal Court has imposed civil penalties for cyber security failures under the general AFS licensee obligations, setting a clear licence-to-operate expectation for robust cyber resilience.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Clients entrust licensees with sensitive and confidential information, and that trust carries clear responsibilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FIIG&rsquo;s&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;failures between 13 March 2019 to 8 June 2023 included&nbsp;examples where it&nbsp;did not:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>allocate the necessary financial resources to have suitably qualified and experienced people available, or implement adequate technological resources to manage cyber security</li>
<li>implement adequate cyber security measures, including multi-factor authentication for remote access users, strong passwords and access controls for privileged accounts, appropriate configuration of firewalls and security software, regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning</li>
<li>have a structured plan to ensure key software systems were being updated to address security vulnerabilities</li>
<li>have qualified IT personnel monitoring threat alerts to identify and respond to cyber-attacks</li>
<li>provide mandatory cyber security awareness training to staff, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>have an appropriate cyber incident response plan that was tested at least annually.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>&lsquo;Entities that fail to maintain proper cyber security controls risk regulatory action by ASIC and exposure to malicious exploitation,&rsquo; the Deputy Chair said.</p>
<p>ASIC expects AFS licensees to prioritise cyber-resilience and invest in people, systems and governance which are fit-for-purpose for entity size and the sensitivity of client information held.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>FIIG provides retail and wholesale investors with access to fixed income investments and bond financing. As an AFS licensee, FIIG plays an important role in providing custodial and trading services, maintaining records of client investments, and holding funds and fixed income investments on behalf of its clients. At the time of non-compliance, FIIG held approximately $3 billion in client assets under management.</p>
<p>ASIC&nbsp;identified&nbsp;cyber-attacks, data breaches and/or inadequate operational resilience and crisis management within its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/news-items/key-issues-outlook-2026/" title="Key issues outlook 2026">2026 key issues outlook</a>, and expects AFS licensees to prioritise and invest in systems that protect their customers and&nbsp;maintain&nbsp;integrity in the financial system.</p>
<p>This case was ASIC&rsquo;s second cyber security enforcement action. In May 2022, the Federal Court ruled AFS licensee, RI Advice, had breached its license obligations to act efficiently and fairly when it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;have adequate risk management systems to manage its cyber security risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2022-releases/22-104mr-court-finds-ri-advice-failed-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="22-104MR Court finds RI Advice failed to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">22-104MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC filed civil proceedings against financial advice business Fortnum Private Wealth Limited in July 2025, alleging it&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;properly manage&nbsp;and mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-143mr-asic-sues-fortnum-private-wealth-for-allegedly-failing-to-adequately-manage-cybersecurity-risks/" title="25-143MR ASIC sues Fortnum Private Wealth for allegedly failing to adequately manage cybersecurity risks">25-143MR</a>).</p>
<p>FIIG has admitted it failed to comply with its AFS licence obligations by:</p>
<ul>
<li>failing to take all necessary steps to ensure its financial services were provided efficiently, honestly and fairly, including by not having adequate measures in place to protect clients from the risks and consequences of a cyber incident</li>
<li>failing to&nbsp;have&nbsp;available adequate&nbsp;financial,&nbsp;technological&nbsp;and human resources to&nbsp;comply with&nbsp;its obligations and&nbsp;support adequate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;measures, and&nbsp;</li>
<li>failing to have&nbsp;an adequate risk management system&nbsp;manage or&nbsp;mitigate&nbsp;cyber security&nbsp;risks to FIIG and its clients.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
