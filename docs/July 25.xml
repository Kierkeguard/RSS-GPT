<li>Eurex Repo saw an increase of 49&nbsp;percent compared to June&nbsp;2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following a volatile start to Q2, a risk-off environment during recent weeks led to calmer market conditions at Eurex in June, with trading volume down 14 percent year-on-year. Overall, Eurex &mdash; Europe&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchange and, together with Eurex Clearing, one of the world&rsquo;s leading central counterparties &mdash; recorded 178.6 million contracts in June compared to 208.1 million in the same month last year. Interest rate derivatives increased by 3 percent to 94.5 million traded contracts. Meanwhile, volumes in equity derivatives dropped by 23 percent falling to 22.3 million contracts, while index derivatives fell by 30 percent down to 60.8 million contracts.</p>
<p>In OTC Clearing, notional outstanding volumes rose by 23 percent in June, reaching EUR 43,415 billion compared to EUR 35,412 billion in the same period last year. Notional outstanding for overnight index swaps jumped by 46 percent to EUR 5,512 billion, while interest rate swaps grew by 28 percent to EUR 18,489 billion.</p>
<p>Eurex Repo, Eurex&rsquo;s leading electronic market for secured funding and financing, delivered a powerful performance in June 2025, with average term adjusted volumes soaring 49 percent year-on-year to EUR 482.9 billion &mdash; fueled by a 43 percent surge in the Repo Market and an impressive 56 percent spike in GC Pooling. Overall, the second quarter was highly successful, with total volumes across all repo segments rising by 18 percent.</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER monitoring show?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>TSOs&rsquo; balancing actions have declined across most EU gas balancing zones: These interventions accounted for a decreasing share of the physical gas market at EU level.</li>
<li>The changing gas market may be reducing the need for balancing. Lower gas consumption and a smaller physical market may have reduced the need for TSOs to actively balance the system. At the same time, higher gas prices may further incentivise users to stay in balance and avoid charges.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER encourages national regulatory authorities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically review the performance of their balancing regimes and assess whether their design should be refined or revised.</li>
<li>Ensure that incentives for commercial balancing are adequate and explore enhancements to information systems to facilitate network users&rsquo; participation.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a hotfix of its Reporting Framework 4.1 to address a series of technical issues identified in the initial release. This hotfix aims to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the reporting requirements by including some corrections.</span></p>
<p>To support transparency and facilitate implementation by reporting institutions, the EBA has also made available a list of issues and inconsistencies found in the original version of Framework 4.1. This list provides a clear overview of the issues addressed and the corresponding fixes applied in the hotfix release, as well as other issues identified that will be addressed in v4.2 for which an interim solution is proposed.&nbsp;The updated technical package and issues list are available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-41">Reporting framework 4.1 | European Banking Authority</a>&nbsp;webpage.</p>
<p>In addition, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-42">Reporting framework 4.2 | European Banking Authority</a>&nbsp;which includes the updated referenced date for modules in release 4.2, the EBA announces the<span>&nbsp;</span>postponement of the obligation to use the xBRL-CSV reporting format. Originally scheduled to become mandatory from the reference date of December 2025, the new reference date for mandatory xBRL-CSV reporting will be<span>&nbsp;</span>March 2026. This delay is intended to give institutions additional time to adjust their systems and processes to the new format.</p>

<title>BME Welcomes IZERTIS On Its Move From BME Growth To The Stock Exchange</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p><img alt="IZERTIS" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/IZERTIS.jpg" title="IZERTIS" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The company is valued at 273.79 million euros.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the second listing so far this year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME has welcomed IZERTIS as a company listed on the main market of the Stock Exchange, after being listed for more than five years on BME Growth. Pablo Mart&iacute;n, CEO of the company, performed the traditional ringing of the bell at the Palacio de la Bolsa in Madrid.</p>
<p>This milestone signifies the achievement of the key objectives outlined in the company's strategy, and BME's objectives to help companies advance in their financing process through the stock markets.</p>
<p>"This is a success that has a two-way impact. For IZERTIS, it is a key step in its growth trajectory; for BME, it represents the materialisation of one of our main objectives: to support companies in their growth journey through the unique opportunities offered by the financial markets. This milestone shows that we are moving in the right direction and that the goals we have set ourselves at BME are being met, step by step", said Juan Flames, CEO of BME, during IZERTIS' stock market debut.</p>
<p>For his part, Pablo Mart&iacute;n, believes that &lsquo;being listed on the continuous market will help us in a new drive, which like all the previous ones will be very ambitious, sustainable and true&rsquo; and added: "During its almost 29 years of history, Izertis has maintained an impeccable path of sustained growth. We hope that in the coming years we will not only continue on this same path, but also achieve new levels, which will allow Izertis to become one of the benchmark technology consultancies in southern Europe".</p>
<p>The initial listing price has been set at 10.50 euros per share, which represents a market capitalisation of&nbsp;273.79 million euros. The company has started trading under the ticker &lsquo;IZER&rsquo;, the same ticker used during its time at BME Growth. This is the second IPO to take place so far this year.</p>
<p>IZERTIS, which specialises in technology consultancy in Spain, has achieved consistent success since it became part of the BME family, first in the growth markets and now on the main stock market. During this time, the company has acquired a total of 24 new companies, increased its turnover from &euro;48.5 million in 2019 to more than 138.1 million in 2024, and tripled the size of its talented team.</p>
<p>Photographs of the IZERTIS Bell Ringing are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/archivobme/albums/72177720327336884" target="_blank">Flickr</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER is establishing a new European Stakeholder Group (ESG) on demand response in the electricity sector. We invite associations that could offer a pan-European perspective on electricity markets to join.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will the demand response group do?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Demand Response European Stakeholder Group (DRESG) will act as an EU-level platform where ACER, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) engage with stakeholders on key matters of demand response. The group will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>discussing proposals for terms and conditions or methodologies required by the new network code;</li>
<li>addressing broader issues related to demand response; and</li>
<li>supporting the practical implementation of the network code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this new stakeholder group, participating associations will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the implementation progress of the code, including how newly established processes function at local, regional and EU level.</li>
<li>Share views and feedback on the code&rsquo;s implementation, ensuring stakeholder input is taken into account.</li>
<li>Support more informed decision-making on the methodologies and rules to be developed under the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing so, the group will support the flexibility required by the EU electricity system (increasingly powered by renewable energy), strengthening energy security and advancing the EU&rsquo;s transition to clean energy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who can join?</span></p>
<p>Associations that could offer pan-European views on demand response in electricity markets are encouraged to apply. Bring your insights to the table and ensure that your voice shapes the future of demand response!</p>
<p>Deadline to apply is 15 August 2025, with the first meeting planned for October 2025.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAANQBVYGBkwMAQVaHVYADVIdCg4GVxpUVFADBlcDAQ4EBggdUFRRVwwCV1sdBFoFUx0GWARRGg1UAQQZBFQHU1IAAFBTUQUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more and apply</a>.</p>

<title>Invest Hong Kong Strengthens Web3 And FinTech Ties Between Hong Kong And Japan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has successfully concluded an impactful visit to Japan, deepening business ties between the two places. The delegation's primary objectives were to promote two-way business opportunities in Web3 and fintech, and to facilitate strategic technology investments that benefit bothplaces.</p>
<p>From June 30 to July 4, Senior Vice President of Fintech at InvestHK Ms Pauline Fan led a delegation of 16 Hong Kong companies, organisations, universities and a family office to Japan. These included Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Web3 Harbour. Meetings and events were held in Osaka and Kyoto together with partners in Japan, including HashPort, Headline Asia, and IVC.</p>
<p>In Osaka on June 30 and July 1, delegates engaged with key players in innovation and digital transformation. They met with members of the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka Digital Exchange, the Japan External Trade Organization, SBI Corporation, Plug and Play Japan, the NTT West Corporate Innovation Center and more. These meetings facilitated meaningful exchanges and explorations of new business partnerships and investments. The momentum continued in Kyoto from July 2 to 4 at IVS 2025, the largest start-up conference in Japan, organised by Headline Asia and IVC. Industry leaders and emerging start-ups exchanged insights on fundraising, business partnerships, and breakthrough trends in Web3 and more.</p>
<p>Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said &ldquo;This delegation marks a significant milestone in solidifying the collaboration between Hong Kong and Japan in innovation and technology. With a strong influx of innovative ideas and investment flows between both sides, we are entering a pioneering era where groundbreaking technologies in Web3 and fintech are poised to redefine the future of digital economies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This delegation visit came at a perfect time following the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government on June 26. It reinforces the HKSAR Government&rsquo;s commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset (DA) field. The statement introduces the &ldquo;LEAP&rdquo; framework: Legal and regulatory streamlining, expanding the suite of tokenised products, advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and people and partnership development. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative DA ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dedicated team at InvestHK is ready to support players in the DA ecosystem, connecting prospective DA service providers with banks and professional services to facilitate their business setup and expansion in Hong Kong,&rdquo; Mr Lau added.</p>
<p><b>Two-way business success driving the agenda forward</b></p>
<p>Japanese firm Zaiko was the first company to establish a presence in Hong Kong through a similar delegation to Japan in 2024, facilitated by InvestHK. As a key portfolio company of Headline Asia, Zaiko serves as a platform that connects creators directly with people through digital events, video streaming, and data analytics. This inward investment exemplifies the potential for Japanese technology expertise to seamlessly merge with the vibrant economic sectors of Hong Kong, such as creative and event industries.</p>
<p>Waffo established a Hong Kong office in 2023 as its strategic hub for Asia and immediately joined the 2024 InvestHK Japan delegation. The company uncovered new opportunities and successfully entered the Japanese market by opening representative offices, collaborating with multiple Japanese clients and launching innovative cross-border payment and risk-management solutions. Leveraging Hong Kong as its launch pad, Waffo once again participated in this year's delegation to further accelerate its growth in Japan.</p>
<p>The Goldian Group is a diversified conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong with a strong background in real estate development. In recent years, its family office has strategically pivoted towards the fast-evolving field of digital assets. With the support and facilitation from InvestHK, the Group has gained access to cutting-edge market intelligence, advanced fintech applications and high-potential business opportunities in Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial ecosystem. Leveraging these advantages, the Goldian Group joined this year&rsquo;s delegation and formally launched a real estate tokenisation initiative in Japan, marking a key step in cross-border digital asset innovation and regional collaboration.</p>
<p>With these achievements, InvestHK&rsquo;s latest delegation clearly illustrates the rising synergy between Hong Kong and Japan&rsquo;s Web3 and fintech industries, a collaboration that promises a new chapter of ingenuity, growth, and mutual prosperity. As both markets continue to harness innovation and investment, the future looks brighter than ever for such two-way partnerships in the digital economy.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Active Share Trading And Two New Listings In The First Half Of The Year</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dynamic trading activity characterised the first half of the year on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The ATX, including dividends, continued to climb from its previous record level. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;in the spring,<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">&nbsp;REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;was the second listing in the direct market plus for small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) this year on 3 July. The Vienna Stock Exchange saw further growth in debt listings, as well as in international equities and ETFs.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/e/a/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025_82af59c8fc.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"So far this year, we have seen uncertainty and a lot of movement on the global markets. At the same time, European investment programmes have also boosted the domestic stock market. This has resulted in noticeably higher equity turnover compared to the previous year. The continued growth in the segment direct market plus underpins the need for uncomplicated and practical access to the capital market for companies," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Equity and ETF turnover increased significantly &ndash; strong internationality</h2>
<p>Turnover from equity trading rose to EUR 36.94 billion at the end of the first half of the year (+19.28% vs H1 2024: EUR 30.97 billion). A study by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/institutional-free-float-in-international-hands-2024/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">S&amp;P Market Intelligence</a>&nbsp;on the institutional free float in the prime market underlines the importance of Austrian stocks for international investors. 92.3% of the freely tradable shares in the portfolios of large investors &ndash; i.e. those holding at least four per cent of the free float &ndash; are held by international asset managers. The majority originates from the USA, accounting for 34%.</p>
<h2>Extensive expansion of ETFs and international securities</h2>
<p>Trading in international securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) on the Vienna Stock Exchange has also increased significantly. As of today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/etf-offering-expanded-07042025" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">50 additional ETFs</a>&nbsp;can be traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange at domestic fees. As a result, the ETF offering on the Vienna Stock Exchange has more than doubled this year to over 280 index funds. The attractiveness of ETF investments is also reflected in trading turnover, which reached an all-time high of over EUR 400 million in the first half of the year. In addition, the international global market segment was expanded several times within the last months: 68 securities from around the world have been included in trading since the beginning of the year, most recently the Swiss SMI index blue chips. Around 900 securities from 28 countries can now be traded in euros, at domestic fees and during Vienna trading hours.</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at record level</h2>
<p>The ATX Total Return &ndash; a performance index like the German DAX &ndash; is one of the top international performers with its year-to-date growth. On 6 June, the national index reached a new all-time high of 10,820.43 points. By 30 June, the Austrian leading index, including dividends, has risen by 26.38% (ATX without dividends: 20.95%), putting it ahead of the DAX (20.09%), Euro Stoxx 50 (8.32%) and MSCI World (8.59%). The market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to around EUR 153 billion at this time.</p>
<p>"The European stock market is on the upswing and Austrian companies are part of this dynamic. They stand out with solid dividends, moderate valuations and strong positioning in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>Debt listings almost at the overall level of 2024</h2>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An investigation opened in November 2024 by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; into senior living sector financier, Senior Trust Capital Limited (<span>STC</span>), is ongoing. STC is an issuer under a regulated offer of shares. On 14 May 2025, STC voluntarily withdrew its public offer of shares. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of the investigation includes considering disclosures made by STC in its previous product disclosure statement (PDS) and associated advertising material and whether those disclosures complied with Parts 2 and 3 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the investigation, the FMA has engaged with STC about aspects of its business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of discussions between the FMA and STC, the FMA has asked STC to disclose certain information to its investors. STC has now done so as part of an STC investor communication dated 27 June 2025, which can be found here:</p>
<p><span class="button-link--white"><a href="https://www.seniortrustcapital.co.nz/assets/default/documents/Investor-Communication.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" title="Link to STC wesbite ">Important update regarding your investment in Senior Trust Capital Limited (STC)</a></span></p>
<p>Any investors who may have queries about the above or their investment in general should seek advice from a legal or financial adviser.</p>
<p>Please note: the FMA has previously issued an update on investigations into Senior Trust Retirement Village Income Generator Limited (STIG). STC and STIG are two different but related entities.</p>
