<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, a neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its July 2025 Mortgage Monitor report. ICE data reveals that beneath the surface of a broadly cooling but stable housing market, early signs of financial stress are emerging among subsets of homeowners. Pockets of vulnerability can be seen in rising negative equity, increased use of mortgage products that improve short-term affordability, and exposure to student loan debt.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Softening home prices expand from the Sunbelt to Western states, driving increased negative equity</span></li>
</ul>
<p>According to ICE&rsquo;s Home Price Index, annual home price growth slowed to 1.3% in early June, and 30% of the largest markets have seen prices dip by at least a full percentage point from their recent highs. While this deceleration may help affordability, it could potentially weaken the equity positions of borrowers who purchased more recently, particularly those using FHA and VA loans, which are low down payment products. Nationally, one in four seriously delinquent loans would be in a negative equity position if sold at distressed (REO) prices. In certain markets, the figures are more pronounced: in Cape Coral, Fla., 27% of all 2023 and 2024 vintage loans are now underwater, while in Austin, Texas, the rate is 18% among 2022 vintage loans.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>ARM and temporary buydown usage reflect affordability pressure</span></li>
</ul>
<p>More than 8% of borrowers financed homes with ARMs or temporary buydowns this year, which reduce monthly payments in the first years of the loan. While these loans provide short-term relief, they may introduce future payment shock, particularly if interest rates remain elevated or reset higher.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Student loan delinquency greatly increases mortgage delinquency risk</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The return of both payments and collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, which resumed in May after a five-year pause, may put additional financial strain on some homeowners. Analysis of ICE McDash data and ICE Tradelines data powered by TransUnion shows that nearly 20% of mortgage holders also carry student loan debt. Among FHA borrowers, that number rises to nearly 30%. Borrowers delinquent on student loans are four times more likely to be delinquent on their mortgage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the slowdown in home price growth may be easing affordability pressures, and negative equity volumes remain low, we&rsquo;re beginning to see localized pockets of recent homebuyers becoming financially exposed,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;Borrowers with minimal equity &mdash; particularly those who purchased recently &mdash; are often the first to be exposed when home prices soften. These early signs of stress highlight the importance of monitoring borrower-level risk as market conditions evolve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE Home Price Dynamics is beginning to show the impact of softening home prices on equity positions in credit risk transfer (CRT) securitizations with the majority of CRT deals issued in 2023 and 2024 having seen modest upticks in negative equity rates in recent months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As figures from the July Mortgage Monitor bear out, national averages don&rsquo;t tell the full story,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing early signs of risk building within specific markets and within specific borrower populations, like borrowers with limited equity or who are behind on student loans. This is when proactive monitoring and data-driven risk management become essential. Identifying and engaging these borrowers early may prevent hardship later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full July Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of May mortgage performance, a housing market update featuring June ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data, an analysis of the impact of student loans on homeowners and a look at loan origination operational trends.</p>
<p>Further detail, including charts, can be found in&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>this month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor report.</p>
<p><span>About the ICE Mortgage Monitor</span></p>

<title>SET Market Report For June 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>Escalating tensions in the Middle East triggered brief global market turbulence as oil prices spiked to USD 70&ndash;80 per barrel. Concurrently, investors closely monitored tariff negotiations following the informal announcement of the agreement between the United States and Vietnam, the first ASEAN nation that reached a tariff reduction deal. Domestically, the Thai equity market faced additional pressure from Thailand-Cambodia border disputes and domestic political uncertainty in June after the Constitutional Court decided to accept the impeachment petition filed by a group of senators and to suspend the Prime Minister from her prime ministerial duties.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that historical precedents show that developed stock markets typically experience brief volatility from geopolitical conflicts or war declarations before recovering with positive gains, a pattern the Thai market mirrored in June. Analysts from major firms advised investors to maintain investment discipline and stay invested to avoid missing market upturns during swift rebounds and to benefit from strong returns that follow.</p>
<p>As Thailand&rsquo;s GDP growth exceeded projections in the first half of 2025, driven by robust manufacturing performance and accelerated export deliveries, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to hold the policy rate steady. In addition, the Thai ESGX funds attracted over THB 30 billion in fund inflow by the fund subscription deadline, buoying the market amid elevated volatility. SET also launched the JUMP+ program, a growth enabling platform designed to accelerate growth among Thai listed companies and strengthen investor confidence.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for June 2025</b><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of June 2025, the SET Index fell 5.2 percent MoM to close at 1,089.56 points, outpacing declines at most regional exchanges, with a YTD decrease of 22.2 percent.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 10.8 percent YoY to THB 39.66 billion (approx. USD 1.22 billion), with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.86 billion, decreasing 7.5 percent YoY.</li>
<li>In June 2025, there was a newly-listed company on mai:&nbsp; Nutrition Profess pcl (NUT).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of June 2025 was 11.9 times, below the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.4 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.4 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.3 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of June 2025 was 4.51 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.30 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of June 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 442,877 contracts, up 24.1 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 438,459 contracts, down 9.4 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>Lloyd’s Managing Agent Authorisation Process To Be Streamlined To Support Growth</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lloyds-managing-agent-authorisation-process-to-be-streamlined-to-support-growth-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lloyds-managing-agent-authorisation-process-to-be-streamlined-to-support-growth-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s (&lsquo;Lloyd&rsquo;s&rsquo;) have agreed changes to streamline the process of regulatory approval for Lloyd&rsquo;s managing agents, intended to reduce the timeframe for authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the changes, the PRA and FCA will retain their statutory decision-making roles but will make increased use of the assessment work already carried out by Lloyd&rsquo;s. This will make decision-making more concurrent, shortening the process, while maintaining high standards of entry. The changes form part of a wider programme of enhanced collaboration between the three organisations to improve effectiveness, efficiency and reduce duplication in oversight of the Lloyd&rsquo;s market.</p>
<p>Following a successful pilot in 2024 in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market, the new approach will deliver a quicker and clearer process for applicants, helping support the development of the Lloyd's and London Market. It also advances the PRA&rsquo;s and FCA&rsquo;s secondary competitiveness and growth objectives by improving the efficiency of regulatory processes and helping to attract insurance businesses to operate in the UK.</p>
<p><span>Gareth Truran, Executive Director, Insurance Supervision at the PRA</span>&nbsp;said: &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve worked closely with the FCA and Lloyd&rsquo;s to see how we can streamline our own processes and make as much use as possible of the review work that Lloyd&rsquo;s undertakes. The new approach will improve efficiency while maintaining high quality outcomes in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market, and is aligned with our secondary objectives for competition, competitiveness and growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Sheree Howard, Executive Director, Authorisations, FCA</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We are committed to being a smarter regulator, supporting growth and reducing unnecessary burdens on firms whilst maintaining our high standards. Our collective work between the PRA, FCA and Lloyd&rsquo;s to co-ordinate assessments will help ensure that London&rsquo;s world-leading international insurance market continues to thrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Caroline Sandeman-Allen, Lloyd&rsquo;s Chief of Market Oversight</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;The Lloyd&rsquo;s market is the preeminent hub for global risk, showcasing the best specialist insurance solutions to solve major and complex issues. It&rsquo;s therefore hugely important that we remove barriers to entry wherever possible, while of course maintaining our stringent high expectations. Today&rsquo;s announcement is a great example of what&rsquo;s possible with close collaboration with our regulators and I look forward to the benefits for our market, and industry as a whole. The Lloyd&rsquo;s market is of integral importance to the UK economy, and plays a major role in sustaining our world-leading commercial insurance sector.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The authorisation of managing agents to operate in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market requires authorisation decisions by the PRA, FCA and the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s. In 2024, a pilot exercise was initiated to explore how processes could be improved for all parties while maintaining existing standards. This has completed successfully, resulting in a streamlined approach.</li>
<li>If applicants provide a high-quality application &ndash; and are motivated and capable to move at pace - then the combined authorisation process could be completed in around 6 months, significantly quicker than the previous 12-18 months.</li>
<li>Further details on the changes to entry processes will be communicated to prospective new entrants via the usual channels.</li>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Five Financial Reporting-Related Legislative Instruments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-five-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-five-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on its proposal to remake five legislative instruments relating to financial reporting relief. The legislative instruments are scheduled to sunset on 1 October 2025.</p>
<p>The legislative instruments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01546/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Non-Reporting Entities) Instrument 2015/841</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01552/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Post Balance Date Reporting) Instrument 2015/842</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01549/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations (Related Scheme Reports) Instrument 2015/839</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01548/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Stapled Group Reports) Instrument 2015/838</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L00737/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Externally-Administered Bodies) Instrument 2015/251</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have assessed these instruments and determined that they are operating effectively and efficiently. Consequently, they continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the effect of these instruments will remain unchanged. We propose to make minor amendments to ensure the instruments are up-to-date and in line with ASIC&rsquo;s current drafting style. We also propose to clarify that the relief in ASIC Instrument 2015/251 is not intended to apply to registrable superannuation entities.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all legislative instruments are automatically repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>ASIC invites feedback on this proposal from industry and interested stakeholders. Submissions should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au?subject=CS%2024%20Proposed%20remake%20of%20financial%20reporting-related%20legislative%20instruments">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm AEST on 1 August 2025.</p>
<p>Refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-24-proposed-remake-of-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments/" title="CS 24 Proposed remake of financial reporting-related legislative instruments">CS 24&nbsp;<em>Proposed remake of financial reporting-related legislative instruments</em></a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01546/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2015/841</a>&nbsp;allows non-reporting entities to prepare their financial statements using the concessions and transitional provisions for recognition and measurement in accounting standards which apply to reporting entities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01552/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2015/842</a>&nbsp;allows entities to disclose a balance sheet showing the financial effect of significant acquisitions or disposals after the balance date in the notes to the financial statements.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01549/asmade/text">ASIC Instrument 2015/839</a>&nbsp;enables financial statements for related registered schemes to be presented in a single financial report.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01548/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2015/838</a>&nbsp;enables financial statements for stapled groups to be presented in a single financial report.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L00737/latest/text">ASIC Instrument 2015/251</a>&nbsp;provides externally administered bodies relief from the financial reporting and Annual General Meeting requirements. It also provides financial reporting relief in circumstances where a company, registered scheme, notified foreign passport fund or sub-fund of a retail CCIV is being wound up.</p>

<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pngx-ctsl-and-pnghri-empower-over-350-hr-professionals-with-financial-literacy-202575/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/pngx-ctsl-and-pnghri-empower-over-350-hr-professionals-with-financial-literacy-202575/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>PNGX Group Limited (<b>PNGX Group</b>), the holding company of </i><i>Papua New Guinea&rsquo;s national stock exchange, in partnership with Comrade Trustees Services Limited (<b>CTSL</b>) and the PNG Human Resources Institute (<b>PNGHRI</b>), has delivered transformative financial literacy training to more than 350 human resources professionals in Port Moresby. </i></p>
<p>The most recent session, held on Friday 4 July 2025, welcomed over 220 PNGHRI members from various industries, building on the success of a previous session for 140 participants just three weeks earlier. These sessions form part of PNGX&rsquo;s broader mission to foster financial inclusion, economic empowerment, and responsible investing in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The comprehensive full-day training covered essential topics including saving, effective budgeting, superannuation, estate planning, and stock market investment. Delivered in collaboration with PNGHRI and CTSL, the initiative is an extension of the highly regarded financial literacy program already being provided by PNGX to CTSL members within the PNG Defence Force.</p>
<p>Participants also gained firsthand insight into the superannuation services offered by CTSL, reinforcing the importance of long-term financial planning and secure retirement strategies.</p>
<h4>Building a More Financially Literate PNG</h4>
<p>&ldquo;PNGX is proud to be a leader in investor education across the country,&rdquo; said Ms. Elizabeth Wamsa, General Manager of PNGX. &ldquo;We believe that a well-informed investment community is the backbone of sustainable economic growth. By equipping HR professionals with these vital skills, we are creating a ripple effect &mdash; empowering organisations to support the financial wellbeing of their employees, families, and communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In developing economies like Papua New Guinea, financial literacy plays a pivotal role in enabling citizens to make informed decisions about their money. A financially educated population is better equipped to build household wealth, participate in capital markets, and contribute to national economic stability. PNGX&rsquo;s education efforts are laying the foundation for a new generation of investors and savers who understand the power of financial planning and long-term investment.</p>
<h4>Impact on Attendees</h4>
<p>Feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive. Attendees noted that the training not only deepened their personal financial knowledge but also provided practical tools to take back to their organisations. Many expressed confidence in integrating financial wellness into HR policies and PNGX training into staff support programs, a step that could dramatically improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention across the country.</p>
<p>The initiative also supports PNGX&rsquo;s long-term goal to establish certificate and diploma-level training for investors, finance professionals, company directors and boards. This vision reflects PNGX&rsquo;s commitment to broadening access to capital markets and ensuring that Papua New Guineans are equipped to actively participate in and benefit from a growing investment economy.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Redinel Korfuzi sentenced to six years imprisonment, and his sister Oerta Korfuzi, sentenced to five years imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court after being convicted of insider dealing and money laundering worth &pound;1m in a case brought by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Redinel Korfuzi took advantage of his position as a research analyst at Janus Henderson. In his role, he had access to confidential information that was likely to have an impact on companies&rsquo; share prices. He shared this with his sister Oerta to rig the system and make money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Korfuzi regularly saw emails from companies gauging investor interest on plans to raise equity in the markets or sell large blocks of shares owned by existing shareholders. Within minutes Mr Korfuzi traded in the shares of those companies across a number of accounts, including those operated by his sister.</p>
<p>The case centred on 13 stocks, traded between 17 December 2019 and 25 March 2021, which generated a profit of more than &pound;960,000. The FCA detected suspicious patterns of trading and analysed large sets of trading data to uncover the crime.</p>
<p>The Korfuzis were arrested in March 2021 as part of a search operation, which was carried out alongside the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>FCA investigators also uncovered an international money laundering operation. While the source of the cash remains unknown, 173 deposits were made into accounts controlled or operated by the siblings from the UK to Albania. This included nearly &pound;25,000 of cash in English and Scottish bank notes that was found in two bags during the search of a safety deposit box in Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p>
<p>'The Korfuzis exploited their privileged position and the confidential inside information they had access to. They rigged the system to satisfy their greed.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re committed to working with our law enforcement partners to fight financial crime and taking forceful action against individuals who undermine the integrity of our markets.'<br /><br />The FCA has begun proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to ensure the benefit of the criminality is removed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>On 19 June 2025, Mr Korfuzi and Ms Korfuzi were found guilty of insider dealing and money laundering following an 18 week trial at Southwark Crown Court in a prosecution brought by the FCA.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 20 May 1987.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Oerta Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 10 September 1988.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the FCA powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by The Criminal Justice Act 1993.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi were convicted of conspiracy contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 to deal as an insider contrary to section 52(1) Criminal Justice Act 1993, between 17 December 2019 and 25 March 2021.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi were also convicted of dealing in criminal property contrary to section 327 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 between 01 January 2019 and 25 March 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The individuals were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/five-individuals-face-conspiracy-commit-insider-dealing-and-money-laundering-charges" title="Five individuals face conspiracy to commit insider dealing and money laundering charges">charged</a>&nbsp;in January 2023. As these offences predate 1 November 2021, when the maximum sentence available increased to 10 years, the insider dealing here is punishable by a fine and/or up to 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The offence of money laundering is punishable by a fine or up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The prosecution were unable to identify the source of the crime from which the cash derived. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>To report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse" title="Market abuse">market abuse</a>&nbsp;to us or to speak to someone about it, please see our market abuse webpage.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.</li>
<li>The trial was prosecuted by Tom Forster KC of Red Lion Chambers and Tom Broomfield and Katherine Lloyd of QEB Hollis Whiteman Chambers on behalf of the FCA.</li>

<p>Two individuals have been sentenced to a combined 12 years of imprisonment for their roles in a &pound;1.5m crypto fraud following a prosecution brought by the FCA.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between February 2017 and June 2019, Raymondip Bedi, of Bromley, and Patrick Mavanga, of Peckham, cold-called victims and sold fake investments in crypto. At least 65 investors were defrauded and lost &pound;1,541,799.</p>
<p>Mr Bedi has today (Friday 4 July) been sentenced by his Honour Judge Griffiths sitting at Southwark Crown Court to 5 years and 4 months and Mr Mavanga has been sentenced to 6 years and 6 months.</p>
<p>Confiscation proceedings are continuing to recover the benefit from the crimes of both defendants.</p>
<p>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Griffiths remarked that Mr Bedi and Mr Mavanga &lsquo;were both leading players in a conspiracy whereby the victims of the fraud were persuaded to invest in crypto currency consultancy&rsquo; and &lsquo;you conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bedi and Mavanga ruthlessly defrauded dozens of innocent victims, and it is right that they have received these prison sentences. Criminals need to be clear that there is a cost to committing crime and we will seek to make them pay.'&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Raymondip Bedi&rsquo;s date of birth is 09 October 1989.</li>
<li>Patrick Mavanga&rsquo;s date of birth is 24 November 1984.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has attempted to contact investors who lost out. Anyone who was scammed by Bedi and Mavanga and has not heard from the FCA should call 0800 111 6768 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:operationhickory@fca.org.uk">operationhickory@fca.org.uk</a>.

<li>The successful prosecution of Bedi and Mavanga follows several other positive results for the FCA in court. In June, it secured convictions against<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-convictions-insider-dealing-and-money-laundering-worth-1-million" title="FCA secures convictions for insider dealing and money laundering worth &pound;1 million">&nbsp;Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi</a>.

<li>Mr Mavanga pleaded guilty to 3 charges on 9 June 2023. He pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud, conspiracy to breach the general prohibition under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and possession of false identification documents with an improper intention at an earlier hearing. Mr Mavanga was also convicted of perverting the course of justice on 7 November 2024 for the deletion of phone call recordings following the arrest of Raymondip Bedi in March 2019. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The sentencing was made up as follows:<br />- Bedi was sentenced to 5 years for conspiracy to commit fraud, 4 months for conspiracy to breach the general prohibition, to run consecutive to the 5 years, and 2 years for each of possession of criminal property and conversion of criminal property &ndash; both to run at the same time as the 5 years and 4 months.<br />- Mavanga was sentenced to 5 years and 8 months for conspiracy to commit fraud and then 6 months of a previous suspended sentence was activated to run consecutive to that, 4 months for conspiracy to breach the general prohibition, to run consecutive to the 6 years 2 months, and 12 months for possession of false identification documents with an improper intent and 9 months for perverting the course of justice &ndash; both to run at the same time as the 6 years and 6 months.</li>

<title>Europex: The EU ETS Remains The Most Cost-Effective Tool To Achieve The 2040 Emissions Reduction Target</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/europex-the-eu-ets-remains-the-most-cost-effective-tool-to-achieve-the-2040-emi-202574/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/europex-the-eu-ets-remains-the-most-cost-effective-tool-to-achieve-the-2040-emi-202574/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europex takes note of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to set a single, binding climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 level, supported by a comprehensive enabling framework. This long-term commitment confirms the EU&rsquo;s continued trajectory towards climate neutrality by 2050 and provides important investment clarity for the pathway to 2040.</p>
<p>The proposals published this week underline the common understanding that carbon markets can and should drive climate action at least cost. To reach the targets set in the Paris Agreement, international cooperation and the scaling of international carbon markets will be crucial. We thus welcome the announced impact assessment on a cautious approach to the use of high-quality credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the EU should actively pursue linking the EU ETS with other mature systems, like the UK ETS. This would provide immediate advantages in terms of price discovery, liquidity and European industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p>As the EU prepares its post-2030 framework, the EU ETS must remain at the heart of decarbonisation policy. Strong market principles, transparent and undistorted carbon pricing, liquidity and integrity are essential to ensure continued investor confidence and cost-efficient reductions in emissions. Europex reiterates its support for the gradual and structured integration of additional sectors into a single ETS. A unified market with broad sectoral coverage would deliver deeper liquidity improved market efficiency and stronger price signals. We therefore welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s early signalling of the intention to integrate domestic carbon removals in the EU ETS. The inclusion of carbon removals in the EU ETS could help create a market signal for investment and innovation in these technologies, provided robust accounting rules and high-integrity standards are in place to ensure a high level of trust in the existing well-functioning EU ETS markets.</p>
<p>The announced review of the ETS Directive in 2026 presents a vital opportunity to futureproof the system. As Europe moves towards greater climate ambition, it will be essential to provide regulatory certainty, clear timelines and a stable investment environment. Europex is committed to supporting the development of the EU ETS as a reliable, efficient tool to reduce carbon emissions at least cost.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER monitoring show?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>TSOs&rsquo; balancing actions have declined across most EU gas balancing zones: These interventions accounted for a decreasing share of the physical gas market at EU level.</li>
<li>The changing gas market may be reducing the need for balancing. Lower gas consumption and a smaller physical market may have reduced the need for TSOs to actively balance the system. At the same time, higher gas prices may further incentivise users to stay in balance and avoid charges.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER encourages national regulatory authorities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically review the performance of their balancing regimes and assess whether their design should be refined or revised.</li>
<li>Ensure that incentives for commercial balancing are adequate and explore enhancements to information systems to facilitate network users&rsquo; participation.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a hotfix of its Reporting Framework 4.1 to address a series of technical issues identified in the initial release. This hotfix aims to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the reporting requirements by including some corrections.</span></p>
<p>To support transparency and facilitate implementation by reporting institutions, the EBA has also made available a list of issues and inconsistencies found in the original version of Framework 4.1. This list provides a clear overview of the issues addressed and the corresponding fixes applied in the hotfix release, as well as other issues identified that will be addressed in v4.2 for which an interim solution is proposed.&nbsp;The updated technical package and issues list are available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-41">Reporting framework 4.1 | European Banking Authority</a>&nbsp;webpage.</p>
<p>In addition, on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-42">Reporting framework 4.2 | European Banking Authority</a>&nbsp;which includes the updated referenced date for modules in release 4.2, the EBA announces the<span>&nbsp;</span>postponement of the obligation to use the xBRL-CSV reporting format. Originally scheduled to become mandatory from the reference date of December 2025, the new reference date for mandatory xBRL-CSV reporting will be<span>&nbsp;</span>March 2026. This delay is intended to give institutions additional time to adjust their systems and processes to the new format.</p>

<title>BME Welcomes IZERTIS On Its Move From BME Growth To The Stock Exchange</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-welcomes-izertis-on-its-move-from-bme-growth-to-the-stock-exchange-202574/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><img alt="IZERTIS" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/IZERTIS.jpg" title="IZERTIS" /></p>
<ul>
<li><span>The company is valued at 273.79 million euros.</span></li>
<li><span>This is the second listing so far this year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME has welcomed IZERTIS as a company listed on the main market of the Stock Exchange, after being listed for more than five years on BME Growth. Pablo Mart&iacute;n, CEO of the company, performed the traditional ringing of the bell at the Palacio de la Bolsa in Madrid.</p>
<p>This milestone signifies the achievement of the key objectives outlined in the company's strategy, and BME's objectives to help companies advance in their financing process through the stock markets.</p>
<p>"This is a success that has a two-way impact. For IZERTIS, it is a key step in its growth trajectory; for BME, it represents the materialisation of one of our main objectives: to support companies in their growth journey through the unique opportunities offered by the financial markets. This milestone shows that we are moving in the right direction and that the goals we have set ourselves at BME are being met, step by step", said Juan Flames, CEO of BME, during IZERTIS' stock market debut.</p>
<p>For his part, Pablo Mart&iacute;n, believes that &lsquo;being listed on the continuous market will help us in a new drive, which like all the previous ones will be very ambitious, sustainable and true&rsquo; and added: "During its almost 29 years of history, Izertis has maintained an impeccable path of sustained growth. We hope that in the coming years we will not only continue on this same path, but also achieve new levels, which will allow Izertis to become one of the benchmark technology consultancies in southern Europe".</p>
<p>The initial listing price has been set at 10.50 euros per share, which represents a market capitalisation of&nbsp;273.79 million euros. The company has started trading under the ticker &lsquo;IZER&rsquo;, the same ticker used during its time at BME Growth. This is the second IPO to take place so far this year.</p>
<p>IZERTIS, which specialises in technology consultancy in Spain, has achieved consistent success since it became part of the BME family, first in the growth markets and now on the main stock market. During this time, the company has acquired a total of 24 new companies, increased its turnover from &euro;48.5 million in 2019 to more than 138.1 million in 2024, and tripled the size of its talented team.</p>
<p>Photographs of the IZERTIS Bell Ringing are available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/archivobme/albums/72177720327336884" target="_blank">Flickr</a></p>

<title>Help Shape The Role Of Demand Response In Electricity Markets: Join ACER’s New European Stakeholder Group</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/help-shape-the-role-of-demand-response-in-electricity-markets-join-acers-new-e-202574/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER is establishing a new European Stakeholder Group (ESG) on demand response in the electricity sector. We invite associations that could offer a pan-European perspective on electricity markets to join.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will the demand response group do?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Demand Response European Stakeholder Group (DRESG) will act as an EU-level platform where ACER, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) engage with stakeholders on key matters of demand response. The group will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>discussing proposals for terms and conditions or methodologies required by the new network code;</li>
<li>addressing broader issues related to demand response; and</li>
<li>supporting the practical implementation of the network code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this new stakeholder group, participating associations will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the implementation progress of the code, including how newly established processes function at local, regional and EU level.</li>
<li>Share views and feedback on the code&rsquo;s implementation, ensuring stakeholder input is taken into account.</li>
<li>Support more informed decision-making on the methodologies and rules to be developed under the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing so, the group will support the flexibility required by the EU electricity system (increasingly powered by renewable energy), strengthening energy security and advancing the EU&rsquo;s transition to clean energy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who can join?</span></p>
<p>Associations that could offer pan-European views on demand response in electricity markets are encouraged to apply. Bring your insights to the table and ensure that your voice shapes the future of demand response!</p>
<p>Deadline to apply is 15 August 2025, with the first meeting planned for October 2025.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAANQBVYGBkwMAQVaHVYADVIdCg4GVxpUVFADBlcDAQ4EBggdUFRRVwwCV1sdBFoFUx0GWARRGg1UAQQZBFQHU1IAAFBTUQUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more and apply</a>.</p>

<title>Invest Hong Kong Strengthens Web3 And FinTech Ties Between Hong Kong And Japan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has successfully concluded an impactful visit to Japan, deepening business ties between the two places. The delegation's primary objectives were to promote two-way business opportunities in Web3 and fintech, and to facilitate strategic technology investments that benefit bothplaces.</p>
<p>From June 30 to July 4, Senior Vice President of Fintech at InvestHK Ms Pauline Fan led a delegation of 16 Hong Kong companies, organisations, universities and a family office to Japan. These included Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Web3 Harbour. Meetings and events were held in Osaka and Kyoto together with partners in Japan, including HashPort, Headline Asia, and IVC.</p>
<p>In Osaka on June 30 and July 1, delegates engaged with key players in innovation and digital transformation. They met with members of the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka Digital Exchange, the Japan External Trade Organization, SBI Corporation, Plug and Play Japan, the NTT West Corporate Innovation Center and more. These meetings facilitated meaningful exchanges and explorations of new business partnerships and investments. The momentum continued in Kyoto from July 2 to 4 at IVS 2025, the largest start-up conference in Japan, organised by Headline Asia and IVC. Industry leaders and emerging start-ups exchanged insights on fundraising, business partnerships, and breakthrough trends in Web3 and more.</p>
<p>Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said &ldquo;This delegation marks a significant milestone in solidifying the collaboration between Hong Kong and Japan in innovation and technology. With a strong influx of innovative ideas and investment flows between both sides, we are entering a pioneering era where groundbreaking technologies in Web3 and fintech are poised to redefine the future of digital economies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This delegation visit came at a perfect time following the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government on June 26. It reinforces the HKSAR Government&rsquo;s commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset (DA) field. The statement introduces the &ldquo;LEAP&rdquo; framework: Legal and regulatory streamlining, expanding the suite of tokenised products, advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and people and partnership development. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative DA ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dedicated team at InvestHK is ready to support players in the DA ecosystem, connecting prospective DA service providers with banks and professional services to facilitate their business setup and expansion in Hong Kong,&rdquo; Mr Lau added.</p>
<p><b>Two-way business success driving the agenda forward</b></p>
<p>Japanese firm Zaiko was the first company to establish a presence in Hong Kong through a similar delegation to Japan in 2024, facilitated by InvestHK. As a key portfolio company of Headline Asia, Zaiko serves as a platform that connects creators directly with people through digital events, video streaming, and data analytics. This inward investment exemplifies the potential for Japanese technology expertise to seamlessly merge with the vibrant economic sectors of Hong Kong, such as creative and event industries.</p>
<p>Waffo established a Hong Kong office in 2023 as its strategic hub for Asia and immediately joined the 2024 InvestHK Japan delegation. The company uncovered new opportunities and successfully entered the Japanese market by opening representative offices, collaborating with multiple Japanese clients and launching innovative cross-border payment and risk-management solutions. Leveraging Hong Kong as its launch pad, Waffo once again participated in this year's delegation to further accelerate its growth in Japan.</p>
<p>The Goldian Group is a diversified conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong with a strong background in real estate development. In recent years, its family office has strategically pivoted towards the fast-evolving field of digital assets. With the support and facilitation from InvestHK, the Group has gained access to cutting-edge market intelligence, advanced fintech applications and high-potential business opportunities in Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial ecosystem. Leveraging these advantages, the Goldian Group joined this year&rsquo;s delegation and formally launched a real estate tokenisation initiative in Japan, marking a key step in cross-border digital asset innovation and regional collaboration.</p>
<p>With these achievements, InvestHK&rsquo;s latest delegation clearly illustrates the rising synergy between Hong Kong and Japan&rsquo;s Web3 and fintech industries, a collaboration that promises a new chapter of ingenuity, growth, and mutual prosperity. As both markets continue to harness innovation and investment, the future looks brighter than ever for such two-way partnerships in the digital economy.</p>

<title>Vienna Stock Exchange: Active Share Trading And Two New Listings In The First Half Of The Year</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dynamic trading activity characterised the first half of the year on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The ATX, including dividends, continued to climb from its previous record level. Following&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/steyr-motors-trading-start/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">Steyr Motors AG</a>&nbsp;in the spring,<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/reploid-group-new-in-direct-market-plus/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">&nbsp;REPLOID Group AG</a>&nbsp;was the second listing in the direct market plus for small and medium-sized enterprise (SMEs) this year on 3 July. The Vienna Stock Exchange saw further growth in debt listings, as well as in international equities and ETFs.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/e/a/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025_82af59c8fc.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"So far this year, we have seen uncertainty and a lot of movement on the global markets. At the same time, European investment programmes have also boosted the domestic stock market. This has resulted in noticeably higher equity turnover compared to the previous year. The continued growth in the segment direct market plus underpins the need for uncomplicated and practical access to the capital market for companies," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Equity and ETF turnover increased significantly &ndash; strong internationality</h2>
<p>Turnover from equity trading rose to EUR 36.94 billion at the end of the first half of the year (+19.28% vs H1 2024: EUR 30.97 billion). A study by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/institutional-free-float-in-international-hands-2024/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">S&amp;P Market Intelligence</a>&nbsp;on the institutional free float in the prime market underlines the importance of Austrian stocks for international investors. 92.3% of the freely tradable shares in the portfolios of large investors &ndash; i.e. those holding at least four per cent of the free float &ndash; are held by international asset managers. The majority originates from the USA, accounting for 34%.</p>
<h2>Extensive expansion of ETFs and international securities</h2>
<p>Trading in international securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) on the Vienna Stock Exchange has also increased significantly. As of today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/etf-offering-expanded-07042025" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">50 additional ETFs</a>&nbsp;can be traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange at domestic fees. As a result, the ETF offering on the Vienna Stock Exchange has more than doubled this year to over 280 index funds. The attractiveness of ETF investments is also reflected in trading turnover, which reached an all-time high of over EUR 400 million in the first half of the year. In addition, the international global market segment was expanded several times within the last months: 68 securities from around the world have been included in trading since the beginning of the year, most recently the Swiss SMI index blue chips. Around 900 securities from 28 countries can now be traded in euros, at domestic fees and during Vienna trading hours.</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at record level</h2>
<p>The ATX Total Return &ndash; a performance index like the German DAX &ndash; is one of the top international performers with its year-to-date growth. On 6 June, the national index reached a new all-time high of 10,820.43 points. By 30 June, the Austrian leading index, including dividends, has risen by 26.38% (ATX without dividends: 20.95%), putting it ahead of the DAX (20.09%), Euro Stoxx 50 (8.32%) and MSCI World (8.59%). The market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to around EUR 153 billion at this time.</p>
<p>"The European stock market is on the upswing and Austrian companies are part of this dynamic. They stand out with solid dividends, moderate valuations and strong positioning in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>Debt listings almost at the overall level of 2024</h2>
<p>The number of debt listings continues to grow rapidly. At the end of June, 12,144 new listings were recorded, almost as many as in the entire previous year (2024: 13,443). The new listings came from over 30 countries, spread across around 360 issuers. This corresponds to around 24% more issuers than in the same period of the previous year. In total, the Vienna Stock Exchange currently services around 1,200 issuers from 44 countries.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>An investigation opened in November 2024 by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; into senior living sector financier, Senior Trust Capital Limited (<span>STC</span>), is ongoing. STC is an issuer under a regulated offer of shares. On 14 May 2025, STC voluntarily withdrew its public offer of shares. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of the investigation includes considering disclosures made by STC in its previous product disclosure statement (PDS) and associated advertising material and whether those disclosures complied with Parts 2 and 3 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the investigation, the FMA has engaged with STC about aspects of its business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of discussions between the FMA and STC, the FMA has asked STC to disclose certain information to its investors. STC has now done so as part of an STC investor communication dated 27 June 2025, which can be found here:</p>

<p>Any investors who may have queries about the above or their investment in general should seek advice from a legal or financial adviser.</p>
<p>Please note: the FMA has previously issued an update on investigations into Senior Trust Retirement Village Income Generator Limited (STIG). STC and STIG are two different but related entities.</p>
