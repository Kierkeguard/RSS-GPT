This is an important step in developing a common European basis for integrating more renewable energy into the electricity grid and meeting the EU&rsquo;s decarbonisation targets. This ACER decision directly supports the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXCQBXUFMAAEwBVAxbHVYJAAEdUF1TVBpUVgVUB1JRBwFSBFMdVwFUBQ9SAlUdUAADDh0GWFUFGg1SAFEZCgIEUlAPB1dZAQUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">EU&rsquo;s Clean Industrial Deal</a>&nbsp;by laying the groundwork for a more resilient electricity system that can power a competitive, low-carbon economy.</p>
<p>The flexibility needs assessment methodology developed by the European Network for Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity), and approved by ACER, will guide Member States' electricity network operators&nbsp;in identifying how much clean and flexible energy their country needs to handle the variability of demand and supply in their power system.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is power system flexibility and why does it matter?</span></p>
<p>Flexibility is the energy system&rsquo;s ability to adapt quickly to changes in electricity supply and demand, without relying on fossil fuels. It enables:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demand response, storage or flexible generation to balance the grid in real time.</li>
<li>Shifting renewable energy from periods of excess (e.g. windy nights) to times of high demand.</li>
<li>Reducing renewables curtailment (wasting renewable energy when the grid can&rsquo;t absorb it).</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlocking flexibility will cut reliance on gas, enable energy transition in a cost-effective manner and help Member States deliver on the EU&rsquo;s binding&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDV1NQB1JVVEwOBQICHVZdAgMdUApTBBoGV1EEAlAFAQMAAwgdVwFUBQ9SAlUdUAADDh0GWFUFGg1SAFEZCgIEUlAPB1dZAQUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2030 renewable targets</a>&nbsp;(42.5%) and climate neutrality by 2050.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the purpose of the national flexibility needs methodology?</span></p>
<p>The flexibility needs assessment methodology provides a harmonised approach for transmission and distribution system operators (TSOs and DSOs) in analysing the national flexibility needs in terms of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the data they must collect; and</li>
<li>how they should assess their national electricity flexibility needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>This harmonised and unified approach serves both national and EU-wide estimations of flexibility needs, with results feeding into reports that will identify how much flexibility is needed, where and at what cost.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are the next steps?</span></p>
<p>Each EU Member State shall now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conduct a national flexibility needs assessment using the new methodology.</li>
<li>Submit it to ACER and the European Commission (by July 2026).</li>
<li>Use the findings to define indicative national targets for non-fossil flexibility (by January 2027).</li>
</ul>
<p>ACER will then publish an EU-wide report to estimate the flexibility needs including a set of recommendations on issues of cross-border relevance at EU level (July 2027).</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>New FSB Chair Andrew Bailey tells G20 in Durban that international coordination is more important than ever.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This letter was submitted to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors (FMCBG) ahead of the G20&rsquo;s meeting on 17-18 July 2025.</p>
<p>Having taken up the role of FSB Chair on 1 July 2025, Andrew Bailey sets his priorities for the FSB, notably:</p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Enhancing surveillance capabilities;</li>
<li>Addressing key risks to financial stability;</li>
<li>Strengthening the effectiveness of the FSB.</li>
</ul>
<p>The letter advises the G20 of the full range of FSB activities, which includes work to improve the data used by authorities to monitor vulnerabilities, promoting better cross border payment services, analysing potential climate-related impacts on the financial system and tackling the destabilising impacts that leverage can have on the financial system.</p>
<p>The letter underlines the need to remain vigilant to the risk of disruptive market moves as uncertainty continues to weigh on growth expectations. Mr Bailey calls for continued global cooperation and engagement against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and rising fragmentation risk, and expresses his commitment to upholding the FSB&rsquo;s mission and strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.</p>

<title>SIX Reports Higher Operating Income And Improved Margin In First Half Of 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>SIX delivered robust financial results, supported by strong organic growth, and made good strategic progress in the first half (H1) of 2025. Key achievements include completion of the Aquis acquisition, positioning SIX as a leading pan-European exchange innovator with access to 16 capital markets across Europe. S&amp;P revised its rating outlook for SIX to stable.</span></p>
<p><span>Selected Financials H1 2025 vs. H1 2024, at Constant Exchange Rates</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Operating income up 4.7%, at CHF&nbsp;823.0&nbsp;million</li>
<li>Net operating income up 4.8%, at CHF&nbsp;741.6&nbsp;million</li>
<li>Operating expenses flat at CHF&nbsp;475.6&nbsp;million, excluding transformation costs (TC) associated with the Scale Up 2027 program</li>
<li>EBITDA excluding TC up 14.8%, at CHF&nbsp;266.0&nbsp;million</li>
<li>EBITDA margin, based on net operating income and excluding TC, of 35.9%, up from 32.8% in H1 2024</li>
<li>EBIT of CHF&nbsp;81.5&nbsp;million, impacted by non-cash value adjustment of CHF&nbsp;69.3&nbsp;million on stake in Worldline</li>
<li>Adjusted Group net profit of CHF&nbsp;111.5&nbsp;million (H1&nbsp;2024 CHF&nbsp;116.4&nbsp;million); Group net profit of CHF&nbsp;42.2&nbsp;million</li>
</ul>
<p>The business environment was marked by lower interest rates, the US tariff policies, and geopolitical conflicts. These developments contributed to spikes in volatility in the equity markets, leading to higher trading volumes. The Group increased its operating income by 4.7% year-on-year to CHF&nbsp;823.0&nbsp;million (at constant exchange rates). At reported exchange rates, this increase was 4.0%. Less sales-related costs, net operating income was CHF&nbsp;741.6&nbsp;million, up 4.8% at constant exchange rates and up 4.1% at reported exchange rates. The transformation program Scale Up 2027 has begun to contribute both to income growth and to cost savings. Associated transformation costs (TC) in the first half of 2025 were CHF&nbsp;31.0&nbsp;million.</p>
<p>Excluding TC, operating expenses were CHF&nbsp;475.6&nbsp;million, in line with the first half of 2024. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) excluding TC increased by 14.8% to CHF 266.0 million at constant exchange rates, with a margin of 35.9% based on net operating income.</p>
<p>On the back of the share price decline at Worldline, SIX adjusted the value of its 10.5% stake in the European payments provider by CHF&nbsp;69.3&nbsp;million. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were CHF&nbsp;81.5&nbsp;million. Adjusted Group net profit was CHF&nbsp;111.5&nbsp;million, compared to CHF&nbsp;116.4&nbsp;million in the first half of 2024. Group net profit was CHF&nbsp;42.2&nbsp;million.</p>
<p><span>S&amp;P Rating Outlook Revised to Stable<br /></span>In May 2025, SIX returned to the capital markets for the first time since 2021 by issuing two new corporate bonds to finance the Aquis acquisition, for general corporate purposes, and to refinance existing debt. Following the closing of the Aquis acquisition, Standard &amp; Poor&rsquo;s Global Ratings revised its SIX Group outlook from negative to stable.</p>
<p>Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern, CEO SIX, said: &ldquo;In the first half of 2025, we delivered strong operational performance and accelerated business growth. The positive momentum confirms that our adoption of more customer-focused structures and offerings is the right path forward. As announced previously, we have raised our commercial ambition based on our strong market position, and I am confident that we are well on track to achieve our 2027 targets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>SIX Growth Journey<br /></span>The acquisition of Aquis, which closed on 1 July 2025, represents a key milestone in the growth journey of SIX. With this step, SIX is creating a leading pan-European exchange innovator with an aggregated 15% market share and access to 16 capital markets across Europe. The transaction strengthens the position of SIX in European trading, enhances efficiency, and delivers new growth opportunities for clients.</p>
<p>As announced on 12 March 2025, SIX launched its transformation program Scale Up 2027 to keep pace with the evolving role of financial market infrastructures and to strengthen its position as a leading player in Europe. With the program, SIX aims to drive mid-single digit income growth and improve its EBITDA margin profile to more than 40%.</p>
<p><span>Business Unit Financial Results<br /></span>In the Exchanges business unit, the trend of rising trading turnovers that started in the second half of 2024 was strongly supported by elevated levels of volatility during the first half of 2025. Combined equity trading turnover in CHF for the first half of 2025 rose by 13.2%, year-on-year. At SIX Swiss Exchange, ETF trading turnover for the reporting period grew by more than 100% compared to the first half of 2024. Market data and connectivity solutions also showed strong results, driving further growth.</p>
<p>The Securities Services business unit again was able to achieve robust growth in its core business areas against a strong comparative period, thus partially compensating for declining net interest income. Main drivers of organic growth were domestic and international custody business, followed by securities finance. SDX business has been integrated into the Securities Services business unit to capitalize on synergies as part of the broader SIX ecosystem.</p>
<p>The Financial Information business unit also continued its growth trajectory. Driven by organic growth and the acquisitions of FactEntry in March 2024 and Swiss Fund Data at the beginning of 2025, the business unit was able to offset negative exchange rate impacts. Main drivers of organic growth were market data and display products and services, particularly real-time data, followed by tax and regulatory services and indices.</p>
<p>Banking Services demonstrated strong growth in debit processing and services as well as in billing and payments. Important drivers were higher transaction volumes as well as debit operations and related digital services.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Investor Alert: ASIC Warns Investors Of Bitget’s Unlicensed Cryptocurrency Futures Products</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/investor-alert-asic-warns-investors-of-bitgets-unlicensed-cryptocurrency-futur-2025728/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/investor-alert-asic-warns-investors-of-bitgets-unlicensed-cryptocurrency-futur-2025728/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is warning Australian investors against investing in unlicensed cryptocurrency futures products offered by BTG Technology Holdings Limited and its related entities (Bitget).</p>
<p>Bitget does not hold an Australian Financial Services (AFS) licence, meaning it is not permitted to promote or encourage Australian investors to invest in its financial products.</p>
<p>Australians investing in unlicensed financial products are unable to access important rights and protections available under Australian financial services laws such as internal dispute resolution processes or client money protections, should something go wrong.</p>
<p>Advertised as &lsquo;Crypto futures trading&rsquo;, Bitget&rsquo;s unlicensed products are offered through the Bitget website and the Bitget app, which is available to Australians for download on several app platforms, including the Apple App and Google Play stores.</p>
<p>Bitget&rsquo;s futures products are high-risk, derivative investments in which investors can speculate on future movements in cryptocurrency prices.</p>
<p>These products can be significantly leveraged, meaning a small amount of capital is required from investors to hold a sizable position in the underlying asset, magnifying both potential gains and losses.</p>
<p>To protect retail investors, ASIC limits leverage ratio limits for certain cryptocurrency derivative products at 2:1.</p>
<p>However, Bitget&rsquo;s unlicensed products are available at up to 125:1 leverage.</p>
<p>For every dollar invested at this leverage rate, there is potential for 125 times magnified gains or losses for investors.</p>
<p>Trading in highly leveraged derivative products can result in substantial losses for investors.</p>
<p><strong>ASIC encourages all investors to do your own research on people, companies and investments before you invest using the below checklist:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Are they licensed &ndash; is the company or person licensed by ASIC to advise on or offer this investment?</li>
<li>How does it work &ndash; can you explain the investment to someone else?</li>
<li>Is it real &ndash; are there signs of an investment scam?</li>
<li>What if something goes wrong &ndash; how do you complain?</li>
</ul>
<p>To check if an entity holds an AFS licence, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://service.asic.gov.au/search/">ASIC's Professional Registers Search.</a></p>
<p>If you invest in something that is unlicensed and unregulated in Australia, it's harder to get help if things go wrong.</p>
<p>For further information, please visit the Moneysmart &lsquo;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/check-and-report-scams/check-before-you-invest">Check before you invest</a>&rsquo; webpage.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Bitget is an international digital currency exchange registered with the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC), meaning it is permitted to offer its exchange services in Australia. Bitget is not licensed to carry on a financial services business in Australia.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s approach of warning potential investors about high-risk products offered by Bitget is consistent with action recently taken by other international regulators.</p>
<p>Since 2022, several international regulators have taken regulatory action in relation to Bitget entities, including BG Limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>On 25 April 2022, Spain&rsquo;s Comisi&oacute;n Nacional del Mercado de Valores issued a public warning that Bitget is not authorised to provide investment services under the Securities Market Law.</li>
<li>On 10 January 2024, the Austrian Financial Market Authority warned on its website against closing transactions with Bitget or BG Limited which are not authorised to carry out banking transactions requiring a licence in Austria and therefore not permitted to engage in commercial trading.</li>
<li>On 6 February 2024, Germany&rsquo;s BaFin (Bundesanstalt f&uuml;r Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht) warned investors against offers from BG Limited and stated that they do not supervise this entity.</li>
<li>On 1 April 2024, Canada&rsquo;s Alberta Securities Commission stated that Bitget Limited is not registered to trade in or advise on securities or derivatives in Alberta. More broadly, it recommended investors not to deal or engage with unregistered firms as there is no assurance of investor protections.</li>
<li>On 3 April 2024, France&rsquo;s Autorit&eacute; des March&eacute;s Financiers warned the public that Bitget&rsquo;s crypto asset trading platform was blacklisted from operation. It advised retail investors to exercise vigilance with investment offerings to the French public via Bitget&rsquo;s digital asset trading platform. Further, it disclosed Bitget as not authorised to provide its digital asset services in France and reserved its rights to take legal action to block Bitget&rsquo;s platform or website.</li>
<li>On 21 June 2024, Cyprus&rsquo;s Securities and Exchange Commission listed several unregulated investment firms including Bitget and urged investors to consult its website before conducting business with any investment firm.</li>
<li>In 2024, Malaysia&rsquo;s Securities Commission listed Bitget as operating a digital asset exchange without registration. It warned that investing through unauthorised entities and individuals, was not protected under Malaysian securities laws.</li>
<li>In late 2024, Japan&rsquo;s Financial Services Agency (FSA) listed Bitget Limited as an unregistered business conducting unregistered cryptocurrency exchange operations in Japan. In June 2025, the FSA listed BTG Technology Holdings Limited as an unlicensed entity soliciting OTC derivative transactions without the statutory registration in Japan.</li>
</ul>
<p>ASIC acknowledges that Bitget has recently added consumer warning disclaimers on its website and app outlining that it is not licensed or authorised by ASIC and that its website and services are not intended for individuals residing in Australia.</p>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The former deputy chief executive officer of asset manager H2O AM LLP (H2O), Jean-Noel Alba, has been fined &pound;1,049,500 by the FCA and banned from the financial services industry.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>An FCA investigation found that Mr Alba lacked integrity because he misled the FCA.</p>
<p>Between April 2015 and November 2019, H2O failed to carry out proper due diligence on investments relating to the Tennor Group of companies owned by Lars Windhorst, or companies he introduced.</p>
<p>The investments were high risk and hard to sell, leaving investor money trapped. In 2024, the FCA agreed that H2O would pay those investors &euro;250 million.</p>
<p>During the FCA&rsquo;s investigation into H2O, Mr Alba provided false and misleading statements and documentation to the regulator. Mr Alba was the principal point of contact with the FCA during its investigation.</p>
<p>Mr Alba asked junior colleagues to create minutes, including records and minutes of committees, where no formal meetings had taken place. Mr Alba also provided due diligence materials, such as investment research, to the FCA that had been created years after the investments had been made, when he had claimed they were produced at the time.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p>
<p>'Senior leaders in financial services need to act with integrity. Mr Alba fell well short of those basic standards.</p>
<p>'He has no place in the industry. This ban and substantial fine should serve as a warning to others that if you mislead the FCA, you will face the consequences.'</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/jean-noel-alba-2025.pdf" title="jean-noel-alba-2025.pdf">the final notice (PDF)</a></li>
<li>The FCA investigation found that Mr Alba breached APER Statement of Principle 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Statement of Principle 4 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way); and Individual Conduct Rule 1 (failed to act with integrity) and Individual Conduct Rule 3 (failed to deal with the FCA in an open and cooperative way).</li>
<li>The FCA previously announced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/h2o-will-pay-250-million-euro-investors-following-fca-investigation" title="H2O will pay &euro;250 million to investors following FCA investigation">H2O would pay &euro;250 million</a>&nbsp;to affected investors following its investigation. The firm is no longer authorised in the UK. Mr Alba was previously identified in the final notice as 'Senior Manager A'.</li>
<li>The French financial services regulator, the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF), is the designated regulator in respect of the collective investments, which H2O had managed on a cross-border basis pursuant to the UCITS Directive. The AMF is the designated regulator of H2O.</li>

<title>S&amp;P DJI Proposes Upgrading Greek Market To "Developed" Status</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Athens Exchange Group (ATHEXGROUP) warmly welcomes the announcement from S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices (S&amp;P DJI) regarding its proposal to reclassify the Greek capital market to "Developed Market" status, from its current "Emerging Market" category. This decision, expected to take effect during the September 2026 index rebalancing, reflects the steady progress and strong momentum of the Greek capital market in recent years, characterized by the improvement of all its key metrics and the ever-increasing confidence of the investment community.</span><br /><br /><span>Mr. Yianos Kontopoulos, CEO of the Athens Exchange Group, stated: "The proposal by S&amp;P DJI to upgrade Greece to a developed market is a milestone for the Athens Stock Exchange and our economy as a whole. It unequivocally confirms our consistent strategy for market upgrading and enhancing its attractiveness. This reclassification is expected to further boost international investor confidence, attract new capital, and broaden opportunities for ATHEX-listed companies. For our part, we are committed to continuing our intensive efforts to fully leverage this significant step, for the benefit of all market participants and the national economy."</span><br /><br /><span>The upgrade to "Developed Market" status, once finalized, is anticipated to serve as a powerful catalyst for attracting new investments from a broader range of institutional investors who exclusively focus on developed markets. This will significantly boost the Athens Stock Exchange's international reach and enhance its growth. Notably, S&amp;P DJI is the first of the three rating agencies that have placed the Athens Exchange on a watch list to announce a specific date for its final reclassification to a Developed Market.</span><br /><br /><span>View the S&amp;P DJI announcement here:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20250723-1478926/1478926_spdji-2025-country-classification-consult-20250723.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20250723-1478926/1478926_spdji-2025-country-classification-consult-20250723.pdf</a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Automation Is Top Priority For Finance Teams Amid Tariff Uncertainty, New Data Reveals - One In Five Finance Leaders Identified Automation As An Investment Priority Over The Next 12-18 Months</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/automation-is-top-priority-for-finance-teams-amid-tariff-uncertainty-new-data-r-2025725/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/automation-is-top-priority-for-finance-teams-amid-tariff-uncertainty-new-data-r-2025725/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>New data from&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/press-releases/tariff-wars-geopolitical-uncertainty-reshapes-european-cfos-strategies-07-07-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lucanet</a>, the leading global provider of end-to-end software solutions for the office of the CFO, reveals that a lack of automation is now the biggest challenge facing finance leaders today.</p>
<p>The findings, based on a survey of senior finance and tax professionals at&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/lucanet-world-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lucanet World 2025</a>&nbsp;- Lucanet&rsquo;s flagship summit - &ndash; show that 32% cite a lack of automation as their top operational challenge, with one in five (22%) identifying it as their leading investment priority over the next 12&ndash;18 months.</p>
<p>This suggests that in today&rsquo;s uncertain economic climate, the limitations of manual processes have become increasingly clear &ndash; sharpening the focus on automation and AI-driven tools as critical enablers of efficiency, agility, and resilience.</p>
<p>Despite the clear need for agile digital systems to mitigate the impact of uncertainty, over a quarter of finance and tax teams (28%) still rely heavily on manual processes. Likewise, only 10% are fully confident in the accuracy of their financial data &ndash; highlighting the need for precise, real-time visibility to effectively model the impact of shifting tariffs and macroeconomic changes on both top- and bottom-line performance.</p>
<p>As a result, it&rsquo;s unsurprising that scenario planning and forecasting remains a serious challenge for finance teams, with over a third (34%) citing it as their biggest concern when it comes to financial planning and analysis.</p>
<p><b>Competitive edge</b></p>
<p>During its flagship event, Lucanet announced the release of all its solutions on the company&rsquo;s unique&nbsp;<b>CFO Solution Platform</b>. The platform now encompasses:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Consolidation and Financial Planning</b>&nbsp;&ndash; automating consolidation processes across different group structures and accounting standards</li>
<li><b>Extended Planning and Analysis</b>&nbsp;&ndash; enabling intuitive collaborative, cross-department operational planning</li>
<li><b>ESG Reporting</b>&nbsp;&ndash; simplifying ESG compliance while supporting the new VSME framework</li>
<li><b>Disclosure Management</b>&nbsp;&ndash; simplifying the creation of disclosure reports</li>
<li><b>XBRL</b>&nbsp;&ndash; simplifying machine-readable disclosures</li>
<li><b>Lease Accounting</b>&nbsp;&ndash; providing a seamless solution for IFRS 16 compliance</li>
<li><b>Tax Compliance and Reporting</b>&nbsp;&ndash; streamlining tax preparation</li>
<li><b>Banking and Cash Management</b>&nbsp;&ndash; providing visibility into cash flow and liquidity</li>
</ul>
<p>Enabling limitless scalability, the AI-infused platform offers modular, out-of-the-box functionalities to suit the individual needs of finance teams, providing easy-to-use interfaces and fast-time-to-value implementations. In addition to this release, the company announced a new data lake, fed by 300+ ETL adapters and operating as the single source of truth for the integrated platform, enabling finance teams to receive valuable insights, crucial for them to make well-informed decisions.</p>
<p><i>"The real challenge isn&rsquo;t just about adapting to any specific issue, like tariffs, but it&rsquo;s a lack of timely and accurate information that makes it difficult to take corrective actions or to plan with confidence. Outdated systems, fragmented data, and manual-heavy workflows make it extremely challenging for finance teams to provide valuable insights, so the business is left flying blind, or worse, paralysed by indecision. We need to be on the front foot when it comes to scenario planning, and focus on building agility into our strategies now. That means leveraging technology to access timely data and real-time visibility into our operations and macroeconomic dependencies, so we can model the potential impact on performance."</i></p>
<p><b>Alistair Gurney&nbsp;</b>&ndash; Chief Financial Officer at Lucanet<b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Looking ahead</b></p>
<p>Tax and finance professionals overwhelmingly see artificial intelligence (AI) as an opportunity rather than a threat. Over two thirds (68%) do not believe that AI will replace their roles &ndash; compared to just 8% who think it will &ndash; suggesting that finance teams see AI as a tool to elevate their function, freeing them from manual tasks and enabling them to play a more strategic role in driving business growth.</p>
<p><b>Gurney adds:&nbsp;</b><i>"While corporates are certainly feeling the pressure of ongoing macro uncertainty, the overall mood is pragmatic rather than panicked. Finance leaders recognise that volatility is expected, and we&rsquo;re seeing firms take sensible, forward-looking steps to build resilience and future-proof their operations."</i></p>
<p>The focus on technology investment echoes the findings of&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/press-releases/tariff-wars-geopolitical-uncertainty-reshapes-european-cfos-strategies-07-07-2025/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Lucanet&rsquo;s 2025 Finance Leadership Panel Report</a>, which revealed that two-thirds of CFOs are prioritizing digital transformation to future-proof operations</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FCA has revoked Carlo Palombo's ban from the financial services industry and is ending its action against Tom Hayes following the recent&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/uksc-2024-0087" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Supreme Court judgment (opens in a new window)">Supreme Court judgment<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;quashing their criminal convictions.</p>
<p>Both of these convictions formed the basis upon which the FCA took its action, with Mr Palombo being banned from November 2022 and Mr Hayes referring the FCA&rsquo;s decision to the Upper Tribunal.</p>
<p>The FCA will take no further action against either individual.</p>

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) announced today that the results of the 2025 EU-wide stress test, including individual results for participating banks, will be published on Friday, 1 August 2025 at 18:00 CEST.</span></p>
<h4>Note to the editors</h4>
<ol>
<li>The baseline scenario for EU countries is based on projections from the national central banks of December 2024. The adverse scenario assumes the materialisation of the main financial stability risks that have been identified by the ESRB in the fourth quarter of 2024, including recent risks assessments done by the EBA and the ECB.</li>
<li>The new EU banking package, which applies from 1 January 2025,&nbsp;is reflected in the 2025 EU-wide&nbsp;stress test methodology and templates, which should however continue being understood as a risk exercise, and not as an exercise that assesses the impact of regulatory changes.</li>
<li>Detailed information about the adverse scenario can be found in the note produced by the ESRB.</li>
<li>The full sample&nbsp;of 64 banks participating in this year exercise can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-01/0246e2f3-fa57-47d1-99f2-7a5b80cae509/2025%20EU-wide%20stress%20test%20-%20Methodological%20Note.pdf" title="2025 EU-wide stress test - Methodological Note">Annex 1 of the EBA methodology</a>.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Issuer Access Platform, a secure web-based communication channel, to be launched to improve communication between listed issuers and HKEX</span><span></span></li>
<li class="spanHeading">Re-designed HKEX website portal to centralise issuer information, offer investors real-time access to issuer updates and boost transparency</li>
<li class="spanHeading">Trial version of the new platform to be available in 2H 2025, with official rollout commencing in phases from the second quarter of 2026</li>
</ul>
<p class="spanHeading">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) is today (Friday) pleased to announce the introduction of the HKEX Issuer Access Platform (HKEX IAP), a new web-based service designed to refine interaction and communication between listed issuers and HKEX, supporting the ongoing modernisation of Hong Kong&rsquo;s market infrastructure. &nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Upon its official launch in 2026, HKEX IAP will become the primary communication channel between listed issuers and HKEX. Issuers and their advisers will submit and publish regulatory announcements through HKEX IAP, as well as interact with HKEX&rsquo;s Listing Division on regulatory matters in a secure manner.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Using a modern and intuitive interface, HKEX IAP will have smart compliance tools such as dashboards, workflow trackers, guides, and automated reminders to support listed issuers&rsquo; fulfilment of their day-to-day compliance and reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="spanHeading">HKEX Head of Listing, Katherine Ng, said: &ldquo;At HKEX, we are committed to elevating Hong Kong&rsquo;s market competitiveness through ongoing modernisation initiatives, ensuring that our infrastructure remains fit for purpose. I&rsquo;m therefore pleased to announce the launch of the HKEX Issuer Access Platform. This underscores our efforts to improve market efficiency and transparency through the use of digitalisation tools, progressing the sustainable development of Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial ecosystem.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="spanHeading">Following the introduction of HKEX IAP, a re-designed, dedicated portal will be available on HKEX&rsquo;s website. This portal will consolidate issuer information, such as executives&rsquo; details, corporate events and other important dates. Investors will be able to access this information, in real-time, upon the update, by issuers, of their details in HKEX IAP, further enhancing market transparency and accessibility.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX will release a trial version of HKEX IAP in the second half of 2025, allowing users to familiarise themselves with its functionalities. Onboarding and user registration guidelines will be published in late 2025, at the earliest. Listed issuers will be able to start using the platform for document submission and communication with HKEX in phases, beginning in the second quarter of 2026.</span><span></span></p>
<p class="spanHeading">Relevant Listing Rule amendments on the launch of HKEX IAP were published in an&nbsp;<span><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/Market-Consultations/2016-Present/May-2025-Uncertificated-Securities-Market/Information-Paper/ip202505.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Information Paper</a></span></span>&nbsp;in May.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Bursa Malaysia Berhad (&ldquo;Bursa Malaysia&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Exchange&rdquo;) is pleased to announce its recognition as one of the Top 50 ASEAN Public Listed Companies (&ldquo;PLCs&rdquo;) and among the Top 5 PLCs in Malaysia at the ASEAN Corporate Governance Awards held last night<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hosted by the Minority Shareholders Watch Group (&ldquo;MSWG&rdquo;), the domestic ranking body for Malaysia, and officiated by YB Senator Tengku Datuk Seri Utama Zafrul Tengku Abdul Aziz, Minister of Investment, Trade &amp; Industry, the ASEAN Corporate Governance Awards recognises ASEAN PLCs that demonstrate excellence in governance, based on the rigorous 2024 ASEAN Corporate Governance Scorecard (&ldquo;ACGS&rdquo;) Regional Assessment<sup>2</sup>. The ACGS is a regional initiative under the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum (&ldquo;ACMF&rdquo;), developed in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (&ldquo;ADB&rdquo;), to assess, enhance, and promote corporate governance among PLCs across six participating ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>Bursa Malaysia Chairman, Tan Sri Abdul Farid Alias, and Chief Executive Officer, Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed, were present at the ceremony. Dato&rsquo; Fad&rsquo;l Mohamed said: &ldquo;We are honoured to be recognised once again<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;at the ASEAN Corporate Governance Awards, which reflects our enduring leadership and commitment in upholding the highest standards of governance, transparency, and accountability. Strong corporate governance is the bedrock of a resilient and trusted capital market. Hence, Bursa Malaysia invariably actively champions governance excellence &ndash; both within the Exchange, and across our ecosystem &ndash; as a key foundation for investor confidence and sustainable economic growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ACGS is conducted biennially, recognising top-performing PLCs that demonstrate strong governance frameworks and practices in line with international standards, with a focus on transparency, accountability, and board effectiveness. The ACGS will further contribute to the ASEAN region&rsquo;s growth and attractiveness to investors.</p>

<div><ol>
<li>Note: Winners are announced in alphabetical order and not distinguished by rank placement within the award category.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>The 2024 cycle was particularly significant as it was conducted using a revised ACGS framework aligned with the 2023 G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance. This updated methodology introduced more stringent criteria, particularly in areas such as sustainability, board effectiveness, stakeholder engagement, and data-driven disclosure practices.</li>

<title>Federal Court Orders UK Firms, Residents From China, Oklahoma To Pay $19M In CFTC Fraud Case</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/federal-court-orders-uk-firms-residents-from-china-oklahoma-to-pay-19m-in-cft-2025724/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced today the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington has resolved all claims the CFTC filed in its&nbsp;</span>September 2024&nbsp;<span>complaint&nbsp;</span>against&nbsp;<strong>Qian Bai</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Chao Li</strong>, both residents of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, their co-conspirator&nbsp;<strong>Lan Bai</strong>, a resident of Oklahoma, as well as&nbsp;<strong>Aipu Limited</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Fidefx Investments Ltd.</strong>, which were both United Kingdom private limited companies.&nbsp;<span>[See CFTC Press Release No.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8987-24">8987-24</a><span>].</span></p>
<p><span>The court found that the defendants, while acting as a common enterprise, operated fraudulent websites that purported to allow customers to trade for over 18 months and fraudulently solicited and misappropriated at least $3,630,849 from at least 34 customers in connection with the sale of agreements, contracts or transactions in leveraged or margined retail commodity transactions, off-exchange retail foreign currency contracts, and commodity futures contracts.</span></p>
<p><span>On July 14, the court entered an order against Lan Bai requiring her to pay, jointly and severally, a $699,534 civil monetary penalty and restitution of $233,178 to defrauded victims for her role in the fraudulent scheme.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On May 22, the court entered a default judgment against Qian Bai, Li, Aipu Limited, and Fidefx, which requires them to pay, jointly and severally, a $13,863,170 civil monetary penalty and restitution of $4,621,056. The default judgment also&nbsp;</span><span>imposes permanent injunctions against them and bans them&nbsp;</span><span>from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets, entering into any transactions involving commodity interests, and registering with the CFTC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Previously</span>, the CFTC and Lan Bai entered into a consent order which imposes a permanent injunction against her and bans&nbsp;<span>her from trading in any CFTC-regulated markets, entering into any transactions involving commodity interests, and registering with the CFTC.</span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC cautions that orders requiring repayment of funds to victims may not result in the recovery of any money lost because the wrongdoers may not have sufficient funds or assets. The CFTC will continue to fight vigorously for the protection of customers and to ensure the wrongdoers are held accountable.</span></p>
<p>Division of Enforcement staff responsible for this case are Karen Kenmotsu, George H. Malas, Michael Amakor, Chrystal Gonnella, Timothy J. Mulreany, and Paul G. Hayeck.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>* * * * * *</p>
<p><strong>CFTC&rsquo;s Fraud Advisory</strong></p>
<p>The CFTC has issued several customer protection&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/index.htm">fraud advisories</a>, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/LearnAndProtect/AdvisoriesAndArticles/CustomerAdvisory_RomanceScam.html">Avoid Forex, Precious Metals, and Digital Asset Romance Scams</a>, which warns users of online dating and social media platforms about an increase in scams that lure victims into sending their money to fraudulent websites that claim to trade foreign currency exchange (forex) contracts, precious metals contracts, and/or digital assets.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The CFTC also strongly urges the public to verify a company&rsquo;s registration with the CFTC at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nfa.futures.org/basicnet">NFA BASIC</a>&nbsp;before committing funds. If unregistered, a customer should be wary of providing funds to that entity.</p>
<p>Report suspicious activities or information, such as possible violations of commodity trading laws, to the Division of Enforcement via a toll-free hotline 866-FON-CFTC (866-366-2382) or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cftc.gov/ConsumerProtection/FileaTiporComplaint/index.htm">file a tip or complaint online</a>&nbsp;or contact the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.whistleblower.gov/">Whistleblower Office</a>. Whistleblowers are eligible to receive between 10 and 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected, paid from the Customer Protection Fund financed through monetary sanctions paid to the CFTC by violators of the CEA.</p>

<title>Q2/2025: Deutsche Börse Group Reports Further Secular Growth And Strong Operational Economies Of Scale</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group has just published its half-yearly financial report 2025 including the figures for the second quarter. Please scroll down for the link to the entire report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overview of the results:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Our net revenue rose by 4 percent to &euro;1,505 million in the second quarter of 2025, mainly due to secular growth factors and despite lower treasury result.</li>
<li>Net revenue without the treasury result, which is relevant for the management of the Group, increased by 10 percent to &euro;1,298 million and was again slightly above our own expectations.</li>
<li>Operating costs saw an expected increase of 3 percent to &euro;620 million.</li>
<li>Our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) rose to &euro;891&nbsp;million, an increase of 5 percent. EBITDA without the treasury result even grew by 19 percent to &euro;684 million.</li>
<li>Net income attributable to our shareholders was &euro;509 million, 2 percent higher than in the same quarter of the previous year, which benefited from a positive tax effect. Earnings per share before purchase price allocation effects (Cash EPS) amounted to &euro;2.96.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Despite the normalization of equity market volatility and a weaker US dollar exchange rate, we confirm our forecast of net revenue without the treasury result of around &euro;5.2 billion and EBITDA without the treasury result of around &euro;2.7 billion for 2025.</li>
<li>Gregor Pottmeyer, CFO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG, commented on the results as follows: &ldquo;Our Group achieved further secular growth in the second quarter. This is the result of our long-term growth strategy, which focuses in particular on product innovation, new client acquisition as well as market share gains. In addition, increased capital inflows into Europe are driving growth in many areas of the Group. Combined with notably underproportional cost growth, we also achieved strong operational economies of scale in the second quarter. We are therefore very confident about the second half of the year and confirm our forecast for the full year despite declining equity market volatility."</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) has published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/securities-law/instruments-rules-policies/3/33-759/osc-staff-notice-33-759-registration-inspections-and-examinations-division-2025-annual-report">Registration, Inspections and Examinations (RIE) Division annual report</a>&nbsp;for 2025. While this report focuses primarily on registered firms and individuals directly overseen by the OSC, firms directly overseen by CIRO and other market participants are encouraged to review the report for information and guidance that may also be relevant to them.</p>
<p>The report discusses important matters impacting registration, outcomes from compliance reviews and ongoing initiatives impacting market participants.</p>
<p>In addition to key achievements on core operational activities, the division accomplished the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>surveying the sales environment at certain bank-owned mutual fund dealers in collaboration with the OSC&rsquo;s Behavioral Insights team,</li>
<li>the second phase of Client Focused Reforms sweeps, focusing on KYC, KYP and suitability determinations,</li>
<li>digital engagement practices review of online dealers, advisers and crypto asset trading platforms, and</li>
<li>reaching several significant settlement agreements through our Registrant Conduct Team.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;This was the year of change for RIE, as we orient ourselves towards the future as a modern, agile regulator committed to upholding compliance in the marketplace. One element that hasn&rsquo;t changed is our focus on assisting firms in meeting their regulatory requirements.&rdquo; said Matthew Onyeaju, Senior Vice President, RIE, at the OSC. &ldquo;The publication of our annual report provides staff the opportunity to share guidance in an effort to assist firms in establishing a strong compliance framework.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The RIE Division is responsible for the registration and ongoing supervision of firms and individuals who are in the business of trading in, or advising on, securities or commodity futures and firms that manage investment funds in Ontario. The release of the RIE Division 2025 annual report comes after&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/news/ontario-securities-commission-sets-out-2025-26-examination-priorities">RIE&rsquo;s examination priorities</a>&nbsp;were announced earlier this fiscal year.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk.

<title>BME Publishes The Playbook With The Keys For An Efficient Transition Of Spain To The T+1 Settlement Cycle</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-publishes-the-playbook-with-the-keys-for-an-efficient-transition-of-spain-to-2025724/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bme-publishes-the-playbook-with-the-keys-for-an-efficient-transition-of-spain-to-2025724/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>BME presents the playbook to facilitate the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME has presented today the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/dam/descargas/estudios/playbook-t1-project-settlement-cycle-reduction.pdf" target="_blank">Playbook Spain T+1<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>, a document that compiles all the conclusions reached by the Spanish task force on the transition to the T+1 settlement cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The migration project to T+1 involves reducing the period between the execution of a trade and its settlement. Currently, in Europe, this period takes two days (T+2), but starting October 11, 2027, this settlement cycle will be reduced to just one day, known as T+1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitioning to a T+1 cycle offers multiple advantages that make the financial market more efficient, competitive, and resilient. Some countries, such as the United States, Canada, and Mexico, have already implemented a T+1 settlement cycle in 2024.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aware of the significant impact this change represents and following the mandate entrusted by CNMV and the Bank of Spain, BME has led the creation of several specialised working groups in Spain to identify the main impacts arising from the transition to T+1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In close collaboration with Deloitte, for this exercise BME has coordinated the work of more than 50 entities from the Spanish financial ecosystem. Organisations have contributed not only from the areas of trading, clearing, and settlement but also from the collective investment institutions sector, represented by Inverco, and treasury management, led by Cecabank. All these entities have been key players in the preparation of the Playbook presented today.</p>
<p>This document identifies and organises the main impacts arising from the transition to T+1 and aims to help Spanish entities internally evaluate the adaptations they need to make to their systems and processes to ensure a successful migration to the new settlement cycle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>SIX continues to work actively to ensure the adaptation of all its services to the new standard, leading specialised working groups both in Spain and Switzerland, as well as actively participating in the various working groups implemented in international settings. These efforts represent a key milestone in the transition process to T+1 in the European Union, Europe, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and the United Kingdom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can explore the SIX T+1 information platform, which allows you to track developments in all key markets, understand local implications, and discover how SIX supports the transition from all angles at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.six-group.com/en/products-services/securities-services/site/lp/tplusone.html" target="_blank">this link<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>
<h5>34<span>th</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2025</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>The company raised &euro;10 million</h5>
</li>
<li>
<h5>Market capitalisation at IPO is &euro;38.5 million</h5>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates Dedem on its listing on Euronext Growth Milan.</p>
<p>Dedem is a leader in automated personal identification systems and a key player in the leisure segment, with games rooms, photo booths and kiddie rides.</p>
<p>Dedem&rsquo;s&nbsp;listing&nbsp;represents Euronext&rsquo;s 34<span>th</span>&nbsp;listing of this year. In the placement phase, Dedem raised &euro;10 million.</p>
<p>The free float at the time of admission&nbsp;is 25.98% and the market capitalisation at IPO is &euro;38.5 million.</p>
<p>Alberto Rizzi, CEO of Dedem, said:&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Listing on Euronext Growth Milan marks both a major milestone and an exciting new beginning. Access to the capital markets offers us a tangible opportunity to build on our legacy of expertise, innovation, and identity to project it into the future. Dedem is deeply rooted in Italy&rsquo;s industrial tradition, where craftsmanship meets technology and vision blends with history. We bring to the market a business model founded on quality, creativity, and social responsibility, a true expression of Made in Italy. We have also chosen to involve those who contribute to our success every day: a portion of the newly issued shares has been reserved for employees with at least two years of service within the Group, giving them the opportunity to become shareholders.</em><br /><em>Dedem has always been a family story, and we want to continue writing it together&rdquo;.</em></p>
<p>Paolo Monte, CFO of Dedem, said<em>: &ldquo;We are extremely proud of this achievement, the result of a journey that began a year and a half ago with the issuance of our first-ever corporate bond, followed by the planning of the listing and a rigorous, in-depth due diligence process. It was a demanding challenge successfully met thanks to the expertise and strong cohesion of our team. But for us, this is just the beginning. Listing on Euronext Growth Milan represents a true growth accelerator, enabling us to confidently embark on a new phase of corporate development.</em><br /><em>Our next goal is clear: to further strengthen our presence in international markets and make internationalization a pillar of our long-term strategy&rdquo;.</em></p>

<title>ESMA Prepares For Switch Toward Single Volume Cap In October 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, announced today the update of the volume cap system, that will pass from the previous double volume cap mechanism (DVCM) to a &ldquo;single&rdquo; volume cap mechanism (VCM) in October, according to the changes introduced by the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation Review (MiFIR Review).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify">The new VCM limits at 7% the trading volume under the reference price waiver in the EU, compared to the total aggregated trading volume in the EU over the last 12 months for each equity and equity-like financial instrument. If the limit is exceeded, trading venues will need to suspend the use of the waiver for the concerned instrument for a period of three months.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">Trading venues must base their decision to suspend the waiver use on the data published by ESMA under the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/volume-cap-mechanism">dedicated VCM webpage.</a></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Technical reporting changes</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">To reduce reporting burden of entities, the future VCM calculations will be based on transaction reporting data collected by National Competent Authorities (NCAs). Therefore, the DVCM reporting system will be decommissioned in January 2026.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">To reflect these changes, ESMA has submitted for adoption the amendment to the Regulatory Technical Standard 3 (RTS 3). Even in case the RTS 3 revision is not yet in place at that moment, the VCM switch will occur at the announced date.</p>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA is currently preparing the new VCM data system. For more details about the formats and templates, please consult the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/volume-cap-mechanism">dedicated VCM webpage.</a></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span>Next steps</span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify">ESMA encourages all interested parties to prepare for the change in requirements in line with the new VCM becoming active in Q4 2025. The first publication of the calculation results is expected for 9 October 2025.</p>

<p><span><span class="xn-person">Adena Friedman</span>, Chair and CEO&nbsp;</span>said, &ldquo;Nasdaq delivered an excellent second quarter performance amid a dynamic market environment. Our ability to deliver broad-based growth through cycles is testament to our role as a partner to our clients, helping them capture strategic opportunities, manage risk, and solidify their operational resilience.</p>

<p>We are executing well on our capital allocation priorities, including repaying debt, and have surpassed our gross leverage milestone 16 months ahead of plan. We will optimize for long-term investor returns as we make organic growth investments and balance further deleveraging with opportunistic share repurchases.&rdquo;<span>FINANCIAL REVIEW</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Second quarter 2025 net revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$1,306 million</span>, reflecting 13% growth versus the prior year period. Organic net revenue growth was 12%.</li>
<li>Solutions revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$991 million</span>&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2025, up 10% versus the prior year period, reflecting strong growth from Index and Financial Technology.</li>
<li>ARR grew 10% year-over-year, or 9% on an organic basis, in the second quarter of 2025, with 12% ARR growth for Financial Technology, or 11% on an organic basis, and 7% ARR growth for Capital Access Platforms, or 6% on an organic basis.</li>
<li>Market Services net revenue was&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$306 million</span>&nbsp;in the second quarter of 2025, up 22% versus the prior year period, or 21% on an organic basis.</li>
<li>Second quarter 2025 GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$738 million</span>, in line with the prior year period. The quarter reflected lower restructuring costs, offset by higher compensation and benefits costs, merger and strategic initiative costs, and increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth.</li>
<li>Second quarter 2025 non-GAAP operating expenses were&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$585 million</span>, reflecting 9% growth versus the prior year period, or 8% growth on an organic basis. The organic increase for the quarter reflected growth driven by increased investments in technology and people to drive innovation and long-term growth, partially offset by the benefit of synergies.</li>

<li><span>Nasdaq continues to execute on its 2025 strategic priorities&nbsp;</span>&mdash; Integrate, Innovate, Accelerate &mdash; positioning the company to capitalize on opportunities for sustainable, scalable, and resilient growth. 
<ul type="circle">
<li><span>Integrate</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Nasdaq is on track to action its&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$140 million</span>&nbsp;expanded net expense efficiency program by year-end, with approximately&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$130 million</span>&nbsp;actioned as of the end of the second quarter. In the second quarter, Nasdaq surpassed the 3.3x gross leverage milestone that was set following the Adenza acquisition, achieving this milestone 16 months ahead of plan.</li>
<li><span>Innovate&nbsp;</span>&ndash; Nasdaq continues to focus on innovating across the business. In July, Nasdaq Verafin announced the launch of its Agentic AI workforce. This suite of digital workers, now in beta testing, has the potential to address the most resource intensive anti-money laundering workflows. For example, when onboarded into a bank&rsquo;s alert triage workflow, the Digital Sanctions Analyst automates the screening, documentation and acknowledgement processes, reducing alert review workload requiring human intervention by more than 80%. Beyond AI, Calypso announced a proof of concept that expands its industry-leading collateral management capabilities with digital assets. The use case demonstrates Nasdaq&rsquo;s ability to integrate on-chain capabilities and help financial institutions manage collateral across asset classes in a more dynamic and efficient manner. Nasdaq became the exclusive distributor of Nasdaq Private Market's Tape D(R) API in the second quarter to deliver real-time private market data and valuation insights to investors.</li>
<li><span>Accelerate</span>&nbsp;&ndash; Nasdaq continued to deliver on its One Nasdaq strategy driving 7 cross-sell wins across Financial Technology in the quarter for a total of 26 cross-sells since the Adenza acquisition. Nasdaq remains on track to surpass&nbsp;<span class="xn-money">$100 million</span>&nbsp;in run-rate revenue from cross-sells by the end of 2027. At the end of the second quarter, cross-sells continued to account for over 15% of Financial Technology&rsquo;s sales pipeline.</li>

<p><span>____________</span>1 Represents revenue less transaction-based expenses. 2 Adjusted and organic change for 2Q25 as compared to 2Q24 are equivalent as they include the same period over period adjustments. These changes are calculated by (i) removing the impact of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates (ii) adjusting for the impact of a divestiture and (iii) adjusting for the impact of AxiomSL on-premises contracts for ratable recognition for 2Q24, which was immaterial during that period. As it relates to ARR, organic changes only exclude the impacts of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates and a divestiture as the AxiomSL ratable recognition adjustment had no impact on ARR. Adjusted operating results also exclude the impact of the previously announced one-time revenue benefit in our Index business in 1Q24 (<span class="xn-money">$16 million</span>), which did not have an impact on our 2Q25 period over period change but does have an impact on year to date period over period results.3 Constitutes revenue from our Capital Access Platforms and Financial Technology segments.4 Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.5 Refer to our reconciliations of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, diluted earnings per share, operating income, operating expenses and organic impacts included in the attached schedules.6&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP operating expense and tax rate guidance are not provided due to the inherent difficulty in quantifying certain amounts due to a variety of factors including the unpredictability in the movement in foreign currency rates, as well as future charges or reversals outside of the normal course of business.7 Message count represents the number of records across Nasdaq's&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;options,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;and Canadian equities markets, trade reporting facilities, and bond exchange that are recorded into Nasdaq's data warehouse on a daily basis.</p>

<p><span>NON-GAAP INFORMATION</span></p>
<p>In addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP, Nasdaq also discloses certain non-GAAP results of operations, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, non-GAAP operating income, and non-GAAP operating expenses, that include certain adjustments or exclude certain charges and gains that are described in the reconciliation tables of&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP to non-GAAP information provided at the end of this release. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of results as the items described below in the reconciliation tables do not reflect ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p>These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to,&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP. We recommend investors review the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP financial measures included in this earnings release. When viewed in conjunction with our&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP measures alone.</p>
<p>We understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as those noted above, to assess operating performance. We use these measures because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance.</p>
<p><em>Organic revenue and expense growth, organic change and organic impact</em>&nbsp;are non-GAAP measures that reflect adjustments for: (i) the impact of period over period changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and (ii) the revenue, expenses and operating income associated with acquisitions and divestitures for the twelve month period following the date of the acquisition or divestiture and (iii) the impact of AxiomSL on-premises contracts for ratable recognition in comparable periods to align with current period presentation. Reconciliations of these measures are described within the body of this release or in the reconciliation tables at the end of this release.</p>
<p><em>Foreign exchange impact:</em>&nbsp;In countries with currencies other than the&nbsp;<span class="xn-location">U.S.</span>&nbsp;dollar, revenue and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Certain discussions in this release isolate the impact of year-over-year foreign currency fluctuations to better measure the comparability of operating results between periods. Operating results excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations are calculated by translating the current period&rsquo;s results by the prior period&rsquo;s exchange rates.</p>
<p><em>Restructuring programs</em>: In the fourth quarter of 2023, following the closing of the Adenza acquisition, our management approved, committed to and initiated a restructuring program to optimize our efficiencies as a combined organization. We further expanded this program in the fourth quarter of 2024 to accelerate our momentum and further optimize our efficiencies (efficiency program). We have incurred costs principally related to employee-related costs, contract terminations, asset impairments and other related costs and expect to incur additional costs in these areas in an effort to accelerate efficiencies through location strategy and enhanced AI capabilities. Actions taken as part of this program will be complete by the end of 2025, while certain costs may be recognized in the first half of 2026. We expect to achieve benefits primarily in the form of expense synergies. In&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">October 2022</span>, following our September announcement to realign our segments and leadership, we initiated a divisional realignment program with a focus on realizing the full potential of this structure. As of&nbsp;<span class="xn-chron">September 30, 2024</span>, we completed our divisional realignment program. Costs related to the Adenza restructuring and the divisional realignment programs are recorded as &ldquo;restructuring charges&rdquo; in our condensed consolidated statements of income. We exclude charges associated with these programs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.</p>

<td colspan="16">(1) Annualized&nbsp;Recurring&nbsp;Revenue&nbsp;(ARR) for a given period is the current annualized value derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. For AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts, the amount included in ARR is consistent with the amount that we invoice the customer during the current period. Additionally, for AxiomSL and Calypso recurring revenue contracts that include annual values that increase over time, we include in ARR only the annualized value of components of the contract that are considered active as of the date of the ARR calculation. We do not include the future committed increases in the contract value as of the date of the ARR calculation. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.</td>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its June 2025 ICE First Look, which shows that while overall mortgage payment performance remains strong, delinquencies rose on a monthly basis while foreclosures trended notably higher year over year (YoY).</p>
<p>Key takeaways from the ICE First Look, which reports on month-end delinquency, foreclosure and prepayment statistics sourced from ICE&rsquo;s loan-level database, include:</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li>The national delinquency rate rose by 15 basis points (bps) from May to 3.35% driven by early-stage delinquencies.</li>
<li>FHA delinquencies, which tend to experience more seasonality, rose by 41 bps in the month, hitting their highest June level since 2013, excluding the 2020-2021 pandemic-era impact.</li>
<li>Serious delinquencies (SDQs) &ndash; loans 90+ days past due but not in foreclosure &ndash; held steady but are up +8% (35K) YoY, with FHA loans now accounting for +51% of all SDQs nationwide.</li>
<li>Foreclosure activity continues to rise off pandemic-era lows with the share of loans in active foreclosure up +10% from the same time last year. Foreclosure starts and sales both rose YoY in each of the past four months.</li>
<li>Prepayment activity, measured in single month mortality, slipped by 6 bps to 0.65% on higher rates, although it remains up +22% from the same time last year.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>Data as of June 30, 2025<br /></span>Total U.S. loan delinquency rate (loans 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure): 3.35%<br />Month-over-month change: 4.74%<br />Year-over-year change: -3.80%</p>
<p>Total U.S. foreclosure pre-sale inventory rate: 0.38%<br />Month-over-month change: 0.20%<br />Year-over-year change: 9.90%</p>
<p>Total U.S. foreclosure starts: 31,000<br />Month-over-month change 9.68%<br />Year-over-year change: 36.50%</p>
<p>Monthly prepayment rate (SMM): 0.65%<br />Month-over-month change: -8.74%<br />Year-over-year change: 21.91%</p>
<p>Foreclosure sales: 6,300<br />Month-over-month change: -9.70%<br />Year-over-year change: 18.17%</p>
<p>Number of properties that are 30 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure: 1,834,000<br />Month-over-month change: 90,000<br />Year-over-year change: -39,000</p>
<p>Number of properties that are 90 or more days past due, but not in foreclosure: 466,000<br />Month-over-month change: 0<br />Year-over-year change: 35,000</p>

<title>ABEX Integrates With Crossover Markets’ CROSSx ECN</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/abex-integrates-with-crossover-markets-crossx-ecn-2025724/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/abex-integrates-with-crossover-markets-crossx-ecn-2025724/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ABEX, a provider of an advanced suite of ultra-low-latency, research-driven execution algorithms purpose-built for institutional digital asset trading, today announced its integration with Crossover Markets. The integration provides ABEX clients - which include quant firms, hedge funds, asset managers, broker dealers and OTC trading desks - seamless access to Crossover&rsquo;s anonymous, ultra-low latency, institutional-only ECN (Electronic Communications Network), CROSSx.</p>
<p>By combining ABEX advanced agency execution algorithms with CROSSx&rsquo;s ultra-low-latency infrastructure, clients gain unmatched tick-to-order performance &mdash; a critical advantage as latency-sensitive trading strategies become more prevalent in digital asset markets. The partnership also offers venue fungibility enabled by Crossover&rsquo;s credit intermediaries, Hidden Road and BitGo&rsquo;s Go Network, allowing clients to buy on one venue, sell on another as well as net settle, thereby reducing counterparty risk and enhancing capital efficiency. Hidden Road is a multi-asset prime brokerage, clearing, and financing platform enabling institutional-grade access to digital markets. BitGo Go Network ensures off-exchange settlement within BitGo Trust, a regulated qualified custodian with $250M in insurance coverage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to add another important liquidity destination, as demand for access to Crossover continues to grow among our client base,&rdquo; said Erkan Kaya, CEO &amp; Co-Founder at ABEX. &ldquo;Bringing together two best-in-class infrastructures - one for matching and one for algorithmic execution - unlocks new levels of precision and performance for the institutional trading community and is yet another example of the maturation of the industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crypto market structure is undergoing a massive overhaul, and technologies like ABEX are meeting the growing demand from algo-based clients looking to track and optimise Trade Cost Analysis (TCA),&rdquo; said Brandon Mulvihill, CEO &amp; Co-Founder of Crossover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe our CROSSx ECN, which heavily focuses on driving down the cost of trading, including market impact, can serve as a premier liquidity destination for ABEX clients looking to optimise their trading needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s news comes amid a period of significant momentum for ABEX, accelerating its mission to deliver smarter, faster, and more efficient digital asset execution for the institutional market. The firm, which is a registered cryptoasset business by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), earlier this year secured a $6M funding round led by MMC Ventures. It has added venue integrations with Binance, Coinbase, Crossover and OKX, and recently had its suite of algorithms selected by LTP for use by the global prime broker&rsquo;s clients.</p>

<title>UK Prudential Regulation Authority To Accelerate Authorisations For UK Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-accelerate-authorisations-for-uk-insurance-2025724/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/uk-prudential-regulation-authority-to-accelerate-authorisations-for-uk-insurance-2025724/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span class="cf0">Today, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2025/july/changes-to-the-uk-ispv-policy-statement">policy statement (PS) 9/25</a>&nbsp;containing its final policy and its feedback to responses received to consultation&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/publication/2024/november/uk-ispv-regulatory-framework-consultation-paper">CP15/24 &ndash; Proposed changes to the UK Insurance Special Purpose Vehicle (UK ISPV) regulatory framework</a>.</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">This PS marks an important step in the PRA&rsquo;s ongoing intention to reform the functioning of the UK ISPV regulatory regime. It intends to enhance the safety and soundness of the insurance sector by making more diversified reinsurance capital available to cedants, whilst enabling the UK to play a bigger role in the global Insurance Linked Security (ILS) market, by making it simpler and more attractive to establish UK ISPVs.</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">The reforms introduce a new accelerated pathway for certain UK ISPV applications (e.g. some types of catastrophe bonds) which meet the criteria set out in the PRA&rsquo;s new statement of policy. Under the accelerated pathway, in collaboration with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the PRA will consider applications and, where satisfied, issue approvals within 10 working days (rather than the current 4&ndash;6-week process) of an application being submitted to the PRA and deemed complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">In addition, the reforms will make it easier for a wider range of current market practices to be undertaken in the UK, while also streamlining and speeding up the standard application and approval processes. Further, both the PRA and the FCA have streamlined the Senior Management requirements for all UK ISPVs.</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">The reforms also clarify the PRA&rsquo;s expectations of UK insurers who cede risks to Special Purpose Vehicles, wherever they are established. This will advance the PRA&rsquo;s primary objectives of safety and soundness and policyholder protection by making more diversified reinsurance capital available to cedants.</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0"><span>Vicky White, the Director for Prudential Policy said:</span></span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">&ldquo;These reforms will deliver a much faster turn-around time for approval of new Insurance Special Purpose Vehicles in the UK, supporting growth and competitiveness while maintaining safety and soundness.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="cf0">To help inform these proposals the PRA convened a number of discussions with industry, including a subject expert group, to gather a broad range of information and explore options for proposed reforms.</span></p>
<h3><span class="cf0">Next steps</span></h3>
<p><span class="cf0">The PRA notes that HM Treasury (HMT) published a consultation on 15th July 2025 on Changes to the Risk Transformation Regulations which seeks to address legislative barriers outlined in CP15/24 and sets out further steps to develop the UK ILS market. The PRA is considering the changes proposed by HMT and the potential to further develop its own policies in a way that advances all of its objectives. The PRA is committed to work closely with HMT and encourages industry participants to engage with both the HMT consultation and the PRA directly to enable future policy development.</span></p>

<title>ACER: Have Your Say On Europe’s Electricity Capacity Calculation Regions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On 2 July 2025, electricity transmission system operators (TSOs) submitted to ACER their&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsAUwcGV1kBUkwIDwxRHVYMDVUdUwBXBRoHBgJUUlFRBQIGBAEdAFwBU1tXUAYdVAtTDx0GW1UFGg1RBlEZAwwGBwIOVVVRUQEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">proposal</a>&nbsp;to amend how capacity calculation regions (CCRs) are defined across Europe. ACER is now gathering stakeholder views to inform its assessment.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are capacity calculation regions and why are they important?</span></p>
<p>CCRs are cross-border zones where neighbouring TSOs coordinate how much electricity can safely flow between them. This cooperation helps boost cross-border trade, prevent grid congestion and price spikes, and support a more secure, integrated European energy market.</p>
<p>There are currently nine CCRs in Europe: Nordic, Hansa, Core, Italy North, Central Europe (CE), Greece-Italy (GRIT), South-West Europe (SWE), Baltic and South-East Europe (SEE). They are key to ensuring efficient electricity use, especially as more countries and renewables come into play.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the amendment about?</span></p>
<p>The TSOs are proposing:</p>
<ul>
<li>adding three new CCRs to the South-East Europe region&nbsp;to cover borders with Energy Community countries (East-Central Europe (ECE), Italy-Montenegro (IT-ME) and Eastern Europe (EE)); and</li>
<li>merging two existing regions (Core and Italy North) for several regional processes like intraday coordination and congestion management.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your view matters!</span></p>
<p>ACER is assessing whether the TSOs&rsquo; proposal supports market integration, ensures efficient use of the grid and supports the well-functioning of the EU electricity market.</p>
<p>To make an informed decision, ACER is organising a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBBwdTBABSVEwKAgdXHVZdBAMdCg0HXxoCUlcBVgFXDgNQUgMdAFwBU1tXUAYdVAtTDx0GW1UFGg1RBlEZAwwGBwIOVVVRUQEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">public consultation</a>&nbsp;from 24 July 2025 to 3 September 2025.&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtVUlcFUVlSUExYBVVUHVYMVAYdC11SXhoGBwsPVQMGVQMAAwUdAFwBU1tXUAYdVAtTDx0GW1UFGg1RBlEZAwwGBwIOVVVRUQEDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Submit your views here</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><span>As artificial intelligence (AI) and automation continue to revolutionise industries, human-centric professional skills such as leadership, emotional intelligence, and problem-solving are becoming essential for organisational success and competitive advantage. SoftSkillingIt aims to democratise access to soft skills training, a critical success factor for organisational growth and personal and professional development.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Soft Skills in context&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The latest&nbsp;</span><span>World Economic Forum&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2025/in-full/3-skills-outlook/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>"Future of Jobs Report 2025</span></a><span>"</span><span>, published in January 2025, analysed the trends shaping the global labour market. 63% of surveyed employers identify skills gaps as the predominant barrier to transformation across most industries and economies. The report underscores that there is a significant shift in demand towards "soft skills," often referred to as human capabilities, as they are increasingly becoming foundational for organisational success in an AI-driven future.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>These findings are backed up by the October 2024 LinkedIn report on &lsquo;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/global-talent-trends" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Global Talent Trends</span></a><span>&rsquo;, which offers data-driven insights into the changing world of work. The report recognises that business success comes down to who has the best talent, not simply the best technology, making it incumbent upon leaders to unlock and develop human capability in an era of widespread AI work. The report found that 69% of senior executives will prioritise hiring candidates with soft skills, with particular emphasis on transferable skills such as problem-solving, adaptability, and collaboration, skills that spur organisational agility.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>There is a clear need for organisations to adapt their recruitment, training, and workforce strategies to bridge this emerging gap, secure competitive talent and equip employees and organisations with the necessary soft skills to succeed.&nbsp;</span><span>Delivered in the right way, in-person coaching, training and mentoring are highly effective; however, they have historically been reserved for top and rising executive talent. With increased demand for the entire workforce to demonstrate higher proficiency in these areas, companies need more cost-effective and flexible learning solutions.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The SoftSkillingIt online course is spearheaded by Julia Streets MBE</span><span>, an acclaimed entrepreneur, advisor, speaker, and certified transformational and senior executive leadership coach. As the Founder and CEO of Streets Consulting, Julia and her team advise a wide range of financial services and technology startups, scaleups, global organisations, and industry bodies, all focused on growth and transformation.&nbsp;</span><span>As a coach, she works with senior and rising executives across the industry to support their personal growth and transformation journeys. She is called upon to speak at and chair many of the world&rsquo;s leading conferences, drawing not only on her industry experience but also on her skills as a speaker, host, and former sell-out stand-up comedian.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Recognised for her significant contributions to business, Julia was awarded an MBE in HM The King's 2025 Birthday Honours list for Services to Diversity and Inclusion in Entrepreneurship, particularly in the Financial Services and Technology Sectors.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Julia Streets, MBE, CEO of Streets Consulting and Founder of SoftSkillingIt, said:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&ldquo;I am very excited to launch SoftSkillingIt today. As a professional mentor and coach, I truly believe in the transformative power of lifelong skills development for both individuals and organisations. I have witnessed firsthand that soft skills are, in fact, the backbone of successful leadership and organisational growth. SoftSkillingIt is designed to foster deep self-awareness and lasting personal growth through research-backed tools and practical coaching techniques.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The World Economic Forum report clearly shows that 63% of surveyed employers overwhelmingly identify the emerging skill gaps as the biggest barrier to business transformation. With AI handling more routine tasks, the value of the workforce increasingly lies in uniquely human capabilities. Skills previously considered "soft" are now foundational for organisational success and employee growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Analytical thinking, leadership and resilience, creative thinking and problem solving, adaptability and flexibility, empathy and active listening are becoming more critical than ever to navigate complex challenges, drive innovation, and ensure successful business transformation in an increasingly AI-driven world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Beyond world-leading reports, my involvement with global organisations, start-ups, scaleups, but also universities and other academic institutions has compounded why the time is now to produce and launch SoftSkillingIt.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Discussions with entrepreneurs, business leaders and professionals across all levels frequently highlighted the widespread lack of soft skills; universities expressed a desire to teach these skills to make students "employer-ready". They all face the same challenge: budget constraints.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>My mission is to democratise access to soft skills training courses while also supporting a charity close to my heart. 10% of every course sold will be donated to&nbsp;</span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://street-child.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Street Child</span></a><span>, a charity dedicated to providing sustainable education models in the world's toughest places.&nbsp; Every SoftSkillingIt student pays it forward to support someone else&rsquo;s learning.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Course Structure</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>SoftSkillingIt is a transformational online course, structured into five core sessions, supported by workbooks, quizzes, and reflection exercises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>The course is perfect for ambitious professionals eager to grow and succeed, including aspiring leaders ready to enhance communication and influence, seasoned managers looking to elevate leadership, and motivated school leavers and young professionals aiming to boost confidence and accelerate their careers. It is designed for those who embrace learning, welcome feedback, and are committed to practical, lasting development, helping to unlock full potential both professionally and personally.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>Participants will learn:</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&bull;&nbsp;</span><span>Critical Thinking &amp; Problem-Solving:</span><span>&nbsp;Transforming leadership and problem-solving abilities by navigating complex challenges, making informed decisions, identifying root causes, and driving measurable results using methodologies like the&rsquo; Five Whys&rsquo; and SWOT Analysis.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&bull;&nbsp;</span><span>Emotional Intelligence (EQ):</span><span>&nbsp;Understanding emotions and empathy as a key to success, learning to recognise, understand, and manage one's own emotions, and to recognise, understand, and influence the emotions of others. High EQ enhances decision-making, relationships, leadership, stress management, and collaboration.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&bull;&nbsp;</span><span>Adaptability &amp; Resilience:</span><span>&nbsp;Confidently navigating career changes and daily life by adjusting to new challenges and recovering quickly from setbacks, crucial for career growth, stronger relationships, and innovative problem-solving.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&bull;&nbsp;</span><span>Communication Skills:</span><span>&nbsp;Exploring essential tools and techniques for clear, impactful, and effective communication, building trust, resolving conflicts, and enhancing collaboration through active listening, constructive feedback, and verbal/non-verbal alignment.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>&bull;&nbsp;</span><span>Collaboration &amp; Teamwork:</span><span>&nbsp;Equipping individuals with vital skills to thrive in any team environment, fostering trust, navigating conflict, and promoting effective team communication in diverse settings, leading to increased productivity and innovation.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><span>SoftSkillingIt offers practical, engaging, and accessible content with real-life examples and interactive exercises, ensuring that the learning is relevant, impactful, and transformational.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Aurojyoti Bose, Lead Analyst at GlobalData, comments: &ldquo;Interestingly, White &amp; Case and Kirkland &amp; Ellis showcase a lot of similarities. Both held the fourth position by value and volume, respectively, in H1 2024 and their rankings jumped to the top spot by these metrics in H1 2025. Moreover, White &amp; Case and Kirkland &amp; Ellis showed improvement in the value and volume of deals advised by them in H1 2025 compared to H1 2024, respectively.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&ldquo;Another similarity is that they both had double-digit deal volumes and some of which were big-ticket deals. During H1 2025, White &amp; Case advised on four billion-dollar deals* that also included two mega deals valued more than $10 billion, while Kirkland &amp; Ellis advised on the same number of billion-dollar deals and mega deals. Resultantly, Kirkland &amp; Ellis, apart from leading by volume, also held the second position by value in H1 2025.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Kirkland &amp; Ellis occupied the second position in terms of value, by advising on $32.6 billion worth of deals, followed by Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher with $28.1 billion, Latham &amp; Watkins with $22.3 billion and Debevoise &amp; Plimpton and Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson jointly holding the fifth position with $16.4 billion.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Meanwhile, Latham &amp; Watkins occupied the second position in terms of volume with 14 deals, followed by CMS with 14 deals, White &amp; Case with 13 deals and Cuatrecasas with 12 deals.</span></span></p>

<title>ASIC Proposes Updates To Guidance For Industry Codes Of Conduct</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-updates-to-guidance-for-industry-codes-of-conduct-2025724/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-updates-to-guidance-for-industry-codes-of-conduct-2025724/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking industry feedback on proposed updates to Regulatory Guide 183&nbsp;<em>Approval of financial services sector codes of conduct</em>&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/regulatory-guides/rg-183-approval-of-financial-services-sector-codes-of-conduct/" title="RG 183 Approval of financial services sector codes of conduct">RG 183</a>).</p>
<p>The proposed updates intend to ensure the currency and clarity of guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s regulatory approach to approving industry codes of conduct by:</p>
<ul>
<li>reflecting legislative reform since the guidance was last updated, including changes to the industry codes of conduct regime under the&nbsp;<em>Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response) Act 2020</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>clarifying ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to industry codes, as well as the criteria and process for our approval of a code, and</li>
<li>simplifying the existing guidance where possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>A copy of the proposed updated RG 183 and a more detailed summary of the changes are available below.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/find-a-document/consultations/cs-26-proposed-update-to-rg-183/" title="CS 26 Proposed update to RG 183">CS 26 Proposed update to RG 183</a></p>
<h2>Providing feedback</h2>
<p>ASIC welcomes feedback from industry and interested stakeholders on the proposed update to RG 183, particularly on whether the guidance is sufficiently clear to meet the needs of users, and where appropriate, any suggested changes.</p>
<p>Submissions should be sent to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:rri.consultation@asic.gov.au">rri.consultation@asic.gov.au</a>&nbsp;by 5pm on 1 September 2025. Feedback provided will not be treated as confidential unless specifically requested.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>It is not mandatory for any industry in the financial services or credit sectors to develop a code. Where a code exists, that code does not have to be approved by ASIC. However, where approval by ASIC is sought and obtained, it is a signal to consumers that this is a code they can have confidence in.</p>
<p>RG 183 provides guidance on ASIC&rsquo;s role in relation to codes, the criteria for code approval by ASIC, and the process for obtaining (and retaining) ASIC approval for a code.</p>

<title>Statement On The Commission’s Status Report In The Climate-Related Disclosure Rules Litigation, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, July 23, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-commissions-status-report-in-the-climate-related-disclosure-ru-2025723/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/statement-on-the-commissions-status-report-in-the-climate-related-disclosure-ru-2025723/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On April 24, 2025&mdash;three months ago&mdash;the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit directed the Commission to provide a status update in the ongoing litigation concerning the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules, which the Commission adopted in March of 2024.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Court &ldquo;directed&rdquo; the Commission to advise whether it &ldquo;intends to review or reconsider the [R]ules at issue in this case.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;And, if the Commission has determined to take no action, the Court ordered the Commission to explain whether it &ldquo;will adhere to the [R]ules if the petitions for review are denied and, if not, why it will not review or reconsider the [R]ules at this time.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The Court&rsquo;s directive was straightforward; our answer is not.</p>
<p>The Commission&rsquo;s Status Report, filed today, states plainly enough that it has no intention of revisiting the Rules at this time.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;That, however, is where our responsiveness ends.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;The Status Report goes on to argue that we cannot expound on what the Commission&rsquo;s future plans might be in the event the rulemaking petitions are denied, because we would be &ldquo;prejudging&rdquo; those policy decisions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;And, the Status Report explains, any future rulemaking should benefit from a court ruling on our statutory authority.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p>We also weigh in on a number of questions that the Court did&nbsp;<span><i>not</i></span>&nbsp;ask of us &ndash; for example, we opine that there are &ldquo;no obstacle[s]&rdquo; to reaching the merits of the case and that a &ldquo;live controversy&rdquo; remains.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p>This purported response is wholly unresponsive.</p>
<p>The Court asked us in no uncertain terms &ldquo;will [the Commission] adhere to the [R]ules if the petitions for review are denied[?]&rdquo; We did not&mdash;but should have&mdash;answered that question. The unspoken truth under this Commission is that the answer is &ldquo;no.&rdquo; Three of the four current Commissioners have been vocal critics of the Rules.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;They have also withdrawn the Commission from the defense of the Rules in litigation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;The Commission simply does not want to say what we all know to be true by now&mdash;it has no intention of allowing the Climate-Related Disclosure Rules to go into effect.</p>
<p>Once we acknowledge this answer, the rest of the Commission&rsquo;s arguments fall away. There are no prejudgment issues, because there is nothing to prejudge. And, we do not need the Court to rule on our statutory authority for the Commission to engage in rulemaking. If there is future rulemaking in this space&mdash;whether to rescind the Rules or otherwise&nbsp;<span>&ndash;&nbsp;</span>that rulemaking may present different legal issues. Whatever those issues may be, and whomever those aggrieved parties may be, they are not now before the Court. Federal courts are not in the business of giving advisory opinions to agencies.</p>
<p>What is crystal clear, however, is that this Commission is seeking to avoid its legal obligations under the guise of conserving &ldquo;Commission time and resources.&rdquo; No matter what, this comes at the expense of judicial resources. As I wrote previously in connection with the Commission&rsquo;s decision to stop defending these Rules,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;the Administrative Procedure Act governs the process by which we make and repeal rules. It includes a prescriptive framework for promulgation and rescission. If this Commission wants to rescind, repeal or modify the Rules, which were promulgated by-the-book, then it must do the statutorily-required work. It cannot take the easy way out. It must engage in notice-and-comment rulemaking, with the benefit of economic analysis and a public, transparent process, even if inconvenient or if the Commission has other, more pressing priorities.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, other Commissioners have acknowledged that doing the work required to rescind the rule would be a difficult lift.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-statement-climate-related-disclosure-rules-litigation-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;So, instead, we once again ask the Court to do the work for us. By asking the Court to carry water that we should shoulder ourselves, we do a grave disservice to our already taxed judicial system. This is not good governance.</p>
<p>The Commission has effectively ignored the Court&rsquo;s order and thrown the ball back at the Court. The Court should decline to play these games.</p>

<title>Statement On Commencement Of Appointment Process For Five Public Company Accounting Oversight Board Seats, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, July 23, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, I am soliciting candidates for all five Board positions, including the Chairperson, of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the &ldquo;PCAOB&rdquo; or &ldquo;Board&rdquo;). The PCAOB was established by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;) and oversees the audits of the financial statements of public companies, brokers, and dealers through registration, standard setting, inspection, and disciplinary programs. Under the Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission selects members and the Chairperson of the Board.</p>
<p>The Act requires that PCAOB Board members be &ldquo;appointed from among prominent individuals of integrity and reputation who have a demonstrated commitment to the interests of investors and the public, and an understanding of the responsibilities for and nature of the financial disclosures required of issuers under the securities laws and the obligations of accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance of audit reports with respect to such disclosures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each Board seat is associated with a set five-year term; any nominee selected by the Commission to fill a seat will serve for the remainder of the term associated with that seat. If eligible, the Commission may reappoint such person to a second, full term. Any Board member, including the Chairperson, may be appointed to any seat. The Chairperson&rsquo;s seat may be filled by either a CPA or a non-CPA, though any member who is a CPA is eligible to serve as Chairperson only if that individual has not been a practicing CPA for five years preceding possible appointment as Chairperson.</p>
<p>The five seats have terms that expire on the following dates:</p>
<ol>
<li>October 24, 2026.</li>
<li>October 24, 2027.</li>
<li>October 24, 2028.</li>
<li>October 24, 2029.</li>
<li>October 24, 2030.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/atkins-pcaob-board-072325?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
</ol>
<p>I strongly encourage applications from candidates interested in furthering the public interest through the efficient stewardship of PCAOB resources.&nbsp; PCAOB Board members play an important role in serving the public interest by helping to protect the integrity of public markets in a manner that minimizes unnecessary costs for the public companies, brokers, and dealers who ultimately fund the PCAOB&rsquo;s budget. In that regard, I note that over the last several years, the PCAOB&rsquo;s annual budget has increased at a rate significantly faster than that of the Commission. This increase took place over a period in which the Board&rsquo;s mission did not change materially. Under the Act, the Board&rsquo;s budget is subject to Commission approval. The Commission&rsquo;s review of the PCAOB&rsquo;s annual budget is an important element of the Commission&rsquo;s oversight of the Board, and I expect that an evaluation of Board member compensation will be among the items the Commission considers in connection with its review of the Board&rsquo;s 2026 budget.</p>
<p>The PCAOB Board member selection process is administered by the SEC&rsquo;s Office of the Chief Accountant. Individuals who meet the statutory criteria and are interested in being considered for a position as Board member of the PCAOB should submit (1) a cover letter, discussing the statutory qualifications summarized above and described more completely in the Act; and (2) a current r&eacute;sum&eacute; or curriculum vitae to&nbsp;<a href="mailto:Boardrecommendations@sec.gov">Boardrecommendations@sec.gov</a>, on or by August 25, 2025.</p>

<title>Cboe Plans To Cease Japanese Equities Operations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>Cboe will maintain presence in Japan for its Global Derivatives and Cboe Data Vantage businesses</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), the world's leading derivatives and securities exchange network, today announced its decision to wind down its Japanese equities business, including the operations of its Cboe Japan proprietary trading system and Cboe BIDS Japan block trading platform. Cboe expects to suspend operations for these businesses on August 29, 2025 and formally close the businesses subject to consultation with regulators.</p>
<p>The decision to close this business reflects Cboe's disciplined strategy to steward resources towards opportunities that deliver the best potential returns for shareholders and was taken in the context of evolving business conditions, which challenged the financial sustainability of maintaining operations of Cboe's equities business in the country.</p>
<p>"While we have made the strategic decision to exit the Japanese equities business, we remain committed to serving Japan and its financial community by leveraging the strengths of our global derivatives and data capabilities," said Craig Donohue, CEO at Cboe Global Markets. "As Japanese market participants continue to seek greater access to international markets, Cboe is well-positioned to meet that demand with our high-quality market data and suite of tradable derivatives products. We thank our partners, customers and stakeholders in Japan for their engagement and look forward to delivering value in new ways."</p>
<p>The company anticipates that the wind down of the Cboe Japan equities operations will have an immaterial impact on Cboe's organic total net revenue growth and adjusted operating expense guidance in 2025. The company estimates that adjusted expense savings will be in the range of $2 million to $4 million in 2025, with savings expected to be in the $10 million to $12 million range on a normalized annual basis. Cboe will provide more details during its forthcoming second-quarter 2025 earnings call on August 1, 2025. A conference call with remarks by the company's senior management will begin at 7:30 a.m. CT (8:30 a.m. ET). A live audio webcast for the conference call and the presentation that will be referenced during the call will be available on the Investor Relations section of Cboe's website at&nbsp;<a href="http://ir.cboe.com/">ir.cboe.com</a>&nbsp;under Events.</p>

<title>NZX Chief Executive Mark Peterson To Depart In April 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nzx-chief-executive-mark-peterson-to-depart-in-april-2026-2025723/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>NZX advises that Chief Executive Mark Peterson has resigned and will depart at the end of April 2026, following NZX&rsquo;s annual general meeting. </span></p>
<p><span> Mr Peterson was appointed as NZX Chief Executive in April 2017. Prior to that he was NZX Acting-Chief Executive from January 2017, after joining in late 2015 as Head of Markets. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Over the last nine years as Chief Executive my focus has been on NZX successfully developing and delivering our growth strategy which included executing new opportunities across our businesses that provide long-term returns for our shareholders and help grow New Zealand&rsquo;s economy,&rdquo; Mr Peterson says.</span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;When the Board last extended my term in August 2023, my focus was on delivering key initiatives that further developed our business. These included launching our anonymous mid-point trading venue, NZX Dark, and the S&amp;P/NZX20 Index equity futures, alongside growing the Smart and NZX Wealth Technologies businesses. By April next year, I expect all these initiatives will have been achieved. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;The company is in a strong position financially &ndash; including NZX Wealth Technologies now being cashflow positive from external client activity. NZX has an experienced and talented senior management team, is operating up-to-date and secure technology infrastructure and has a positive organisational culture and relationships with customers, stakeholders and shareholders. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;This demonstrates the time is right for me to stand down and for the NZX Board to appoint a new chief executive to lead NZX into the future and continue to deliver its strategic priorities. By announcing my departure now, I wanted to ensure a smooth transition by giving the Board plenty of time to search for a new chief executive who will continue the positive momentum and growth opportunities in front of NZX.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span> NZX Chair John McMahon says Mr Peterson has been an exceptional leader of NZX and will leave a strong legacy. &ldquo;He is a highly effective all-round performer who has calmly and ably led the NZX Group through some challenging and volatile times,&rdquo; Mr McMahon says. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Since delivering a revised strategy in late 2017, NZX&rsquo;s operating earnings have increased from $28.6 million to $48.5 million; Smart&rsquo;s funds under administration has increased from $2.9 billion to $13.7 billion; NZX Wealth Technologies&rsquo; funds under administration has grown from $2 billion to $17.2 billion and is now cashflow positive on external client activity; and volume traded under our dairy derivatives partnership with SGX has almost doubled. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;Mark has also built strong relationships in New Zealand and internationally, in particular the business partnerships we have with the Singapore Stock Exchange and the European Energy Exchange. In addition, NZX has built strong relationships with the New Zealand Government and regulators in developing appropriate initiatives and market regulatory settings to encourage investment and boost liquidity. We look forward to changes being progressively rolled out. In June, it was pleasing to see the Financial Markets Authority in its annual market operator obligations review acknowledge the work Mark and his team have done to ensure fair, efficient, and transparent capital markets. </span></p>
<p><span> &ldquo;On behalf of NZX, we thank Mark for his first-class leadership and long service to the business and New Zealand&rsquo;s capital markets.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span> Mr McMahon says the Board will conduct an internal and external search, including internationally, for a new chief executive.</span></p>

<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Market Oversight and the Division of Clearing and Risk today announced they have taken a no-action position regarding swap data reporting and recordkeeping regulations in response to a request from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc., a designated contract market and derivatives clearing organization.</p>
<p>The divisions will not recommend the CFTC initiate an enforcement action against CME or its participants for failure to comply with certain swap-related recordkeeping requirements and for failure to report to swap data repositories data associated with binary option transactions executed on or subject to the rules of CME, subject to the terms of the no-action letter. The no-action letter applies only&nbsp;in narrow circumstances and is comparable to no-action letters issued for other similarly situated designated contract markets and derivatives clearing organizations.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission: Stéphane Gagnon Sentenced To Five Years And Ordered To Pay Over $7.75 Million</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-stphane-gagnon-sentenced-to-five-years-and-order-2025723/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-stphane-gagnon-sentenced-to-five-years-and-order-2025723/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announced today that St&eacute;phane Gagnon, formerly of Ottawa, Ontario was convicted on one count of Fraud over $5,000 contrary to Section 380(1)(a) of the&nbsp;<em>Criminal Code (Code)&nbsp;</em>and one count of &lsquo;Use of Forged Document&rsquo; contrary to Section 368(1) of the&nbsp;<em>Code</em>.</p>
<p>Mr. Gagnon was found guilty by the Superior Court of Justice in Toronto and was sentenced to 5 years in jail less time served and was also ordered to pay back the whole net amount of the fraud totaling over $7.75 million. The court ordered restitution to the victims and a fine in lieu of forfeiture. If Mr. Gagnon does not pay the fine, he may serve additional time in jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s decision is a significant outcome for Ontario&rsquo;s investors who were harmed by Mr. Gagnon&rsquo;s actions,&rdquo; said Bonnie Lysyk, Executive Vice President of Enforcement at the OSC. &ldquo;Where the OSC sees evidence of harm, we will take action to protect investors, and the integrity of our capital markets. We are pleased with the judgment of the Superior Court and thank everyone involved in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an agreed statement presented to the Court, Mr. Gagnon admitted that between August 1, 2015, and May 31, 2021, he received more than $20 million from victims across Canada. He advertised to the public that he could help people access funds in their locked-in retirement accounts if they invested their money in his company. Mr. Gagnon accepted funds from more than 300 investors and then used a significant portion of the money for other purposes. He also admitted that he used forged lawyers&rsquo; letters to attempt to continue his business relationship with one of the trust companies into which the victims&rsquo; money had been deposited.</p>
<p>This case was brought by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces. Charges laid under the Securities Act are prosecuted by the OSC. Charges laid under the Criminal Code are prosecuted by the Ministry of the Attorney General.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets, and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">https://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<title>ISDA derivatiViews: Strengthening DC Governance</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-strengthening-dc-governance-2025723/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/isda-derivativiews-strengthening-dc-governance-2025723/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committees (DCs) play a vital role. Without a single, industry-wide determination on whether a credit event has occurred, it simply wouldn&rsquo;t be possible to clear credit default swaps (CDS), making the market less safe and less efficient. It&rsquo;s therefore critical the DC process remains strong, transparent and trusted &ndash; and the DCs have this week taken an important step to ensure that&rsquo;s the case by voting to amend the DC rules to form a governance committee under a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/book/charter-for-the-credit-derivatives-governance-committee/">charter</a>&nbsp;developed by ISDA&rsquo;s Credit Steering Committee and published by ISDA.</p>
<p>This governance committee will be responsible for overseeing the operation of the DCs and making changes to the DC rules where necessary to ensure long-term viability and meet market expectations for efficiency and transparency in credit event determinations. The governance committee isn&rsquo;t allowed to have any involvement in DC decisions, guaranteeing separation between the determinations process and the procedure for setting the structure and framework of the DCs. Any proposed rule change would be open to market consultation for at least 30 days before a vote by the governance committee, enabling industry participants to feed into the process.</p>
<p>The first committee comprises representatives from 18 firms active in the CDS markets &ndash; five buy-side and 10 sell-side firms, along with ICE Clear Credit, LCH and S&amp;P Global. The individuals at these firms must have significant experience in the CDS market and, if the firm is a DC member, cannot also be the firm&rsquo;s primary DC representative.</p>
<p>This represents a significant change in the governance of the DCs that will support a robust process for updating the DC rules. Back in December 2023,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2023/12/14/isda-launches-independent-review-of-dc-process/">ISDA launched an independent review</a>&nbsp;of the structure and governance of the DCs with the aim of maintaining the integrity of the DC process. That culminated in a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/05/13/isda-publishes-dc-review-and-launches-market-consultation/">series of recommendations</a>&nbsp;that were put out for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2024/09/19/isda-publishes-results-of-dc-review-consultation/">market consultation last year</a>. The idea of a separate governance body garnered significant support during that consultation, prompting us to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/2025/05/08/isda-publishes-governance-committee-proposal-for-cds-determinations-committees/">draft a proposal</a>&nbsp;for consultation in May. But other potential changes also proved popular, including appointing up to three independent members of the DCs, requiring the DCs and the DC secretary to provide adequate reasons for all material decisions they take and disclosing any material steps taken in the DC process on the DC website.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s our intention to work with industry participants to develop detailed proposals for other recommendations that have received strong market support and to present these to the governance committee for a vote.</p>
<p>A robust, standardized determinations process that is binding on all market participants is critical for central clearing, which, in turn, significantly reduces risk in the financial system. But that determinations process needs to be trusted and transparent. The decision by the DCs to vote in favor of the governance committee charter is an important milestone in evolving the DCs to strengthen that trust, ensuring the credit derivatives market continues to function safely and efficiently.</p>

<title>Finansinspektionen Analysis 49: Increased Concentration In Trading On The Swedish Bond Markets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The turnover and the number of actors on the bond markets have decreased in recent years. Trading of government bonds has become more concentrated to a few large firms, which makes the market vulnerable to shocks. This is the conclusion of a new analysis by Finansinspektionen (FI).</span></p>
<div class="editor-content">
<p>FI has examined trading on the secondary market for Swedish nominal government bonds and covered bonds during the period 2018-2024. The government uses government bonds to borrow money for its operations, while banks use covered bonds to finance mortgages. The covered bonds are backed by collateral in the form of residential property.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"A key feature of a stable financial system is that the government bond and covered bond markets function as they should. A shock to these markets could spread to other parts of the financial system and by extension impact overall financial stability. FI therefore follows the developments on these markets very closely," says FI's Chief Economist Jon Thor Sturluson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FI's analysis shows that the turnover and the number of actors on the bond markets have gradually decreased over the past few years. On the government bond markets, the market makers, in other words the financial firms that broker Swedish government securities, represent an increasing share of trading. The market has thus become more vulnerable to operating shocks that would render any of these firms unavailable for trading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Continuously following the developments on these markets is an important part of FI's assignment to contribute to a stable financial system characterised by well-functioning markets.</p>

<title>The EBA Publishes Report On Direct Provision Of Banking Services From Third Countries</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-report-on-direct-provision-of-banking-services-from-third-coun-2025723/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-publishes-report-on-direct-provision-of-banking-services-from-third-coun-2025723/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a Report on the direct provision of banking services from third countries.&nbsp; The quantitative and qualitative analysis performed didn&rsquo;t provide evidence to recommend the amendment of the new Article 21c of the Capital Requirement Directive (CRD) which identifies how core banking services should be provided in a Member State. However, the EBA suggests a clarification of the interaction between Article 21c of the CRD and other sectorial legislations could be beneficial to authorities and market participants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>​The EBA considers that several factors make it difficult to measure the impact of the prohibition of direct provision of services from third countries set out in Article 21c CRD. At the same time, Article 21c of the CRD provides flexibility to EU financial sector entities that remain free to solicit core banking services from third country undertakings or may rely on services provided by third country branches or subsidiaries in the EU.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​However, the EBA notes that Article 21c CRD does not expressly address the interaction with the Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD), in particular those provisions entitling EU financial sector entities to receive core banking services for their ongoing operationality in third countries in accordance with their business model. The EBA suggests that additional clarification could also be provided via the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/single-rule-book-qa" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA Q&amp;A tool</a>. ​&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Legal basis and background&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>Article 21c CRD aims to regulate when a third country branch needs to be established for the provision of core banking services in a relevant Member State. Article 21c CRD also provides exemptions and carve outs, embedding some flexibility in the articulation of such requirement. Notably, the establishment of a third-country branch is not required in case of interbank or intragroup transactions, or where the core banking services are provided via reverse solicitation. Additionally, Article 21c provides for a Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) carve out, which excludes its application where investment services under MiFID and related ancillary services are provided. Lastly, to facilitate the transition to the new regime, a contract grandfathering is envisaged.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The EBA has been mandated by article 21c(6) CRD to develop a Report to assess whether it is appropriate to extend the possibility for third country undertakings to provide core banking services directly from third countries &ndash; i.e. without a branch in the Union - not only to EU credit institutions, but to any EU financial sector entity, having regard to financial stability and EU competitiveness considerations. For this purpose, the EBA has to consult the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA). &nbsp;</p>

<p>As geopolitical tensions rise, and hybrid threats, combining cyber, physical, and informational tactics, impact both private and public sectors, organizations face increasing challenges from sophisticated adversaries. This partnership&nbsp; brings together two industry leaders to meet that challenge head-on.

<p>Flashpoint&rsquo;s curated, primary-source data provides unique depth and context, empowering investigators to initiate new inquiries and solve cases by uncovering hidden connections.

The integrated solution offers a flexible, unified environment tailored to each organization&rsquo;s needs, supporting various applications including public safety, fraud prevention, anti money laundering, and cryptocurrency crime.</p>

"This integration delivers on that need. Combining Flashpoint&rsquo;s unmatched collections with Siren&rsquo;s investigative power gives multinational organizations a more actionable view of their risk landscape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The OSINT&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.specialeurasia.com/2025/03/24/osint-market-ai-integration/" id="OWA693c589d-00ee-91b9-36f3-a72dcabac2a7" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">market</a></span></span>&nbsp; is rapidly growing, valued at $13.5 billion in 2023 and projected to reach $43.3 billion by 2033, driven by demand for real-time, cross-domain intelligence.</p>
<p>This partnership addresses that demand by offering:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>A unified end-to-end investigation experience -&nbsp;</b>One interface to analyze Flashpoint collections alongside Publicly and Commercially Available Information (PAI and CAI), social media, law enforcement data, cyber threat intelligence, blockchain analytics, geospatial sources, and more.<br /><br /></li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>CoinShares International Limited ("CoinShares" or "the Group") (Nasdaq Stockholm: CS; US OTCQX: CNSRF)</b>, the European leading investment company specialising in digital assets with over $9 billion in assets under management, today announced its French subsidiary, CoinShares Asset Management, has received authorisation under the Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) Regulation, making it the first continental European regulated asset management company to achieve this milestone.</p>
<p>This authorisation positions CoinShares as the only asset management firm in continental Europe to hold a rare triple regulatory license combination, enabling comprehensive investment services across all asset classes throughout the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>AIFM License</b> &ndash; Alternative Investment Fund Management and delegated UCITS management </li>
<li><b>MiFID License</b> &ndash; Portfolio management and investment advice on traditional financial instruments </li>
<li><b>MiCA Authorisation</b> &ndash; Portfolio management and advice on crypto-assets</li>
</ul>
<h4>Setting New Standards for Professional Crypto Asset Management</h4>
<p>The MiCA authorisation enables CoinShares to provide institutional-grade portfolio management services across all asset classes and investment vehicle types throughout the EU, with operations currently passported in France, Germany, Cyprus, Ireland, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, and the Netherlands, with possibility to extend across all EU member states.</p>
<p>This regulatory achievement directly addresses a critical gap in the European crypto investment landscape, where many platforms present themselves as asset managers without the proper licensing, organisational structure, or necessary separation of duties between custody, administration, execution, and portfolio management functions.</p>
<p>Jean-Marie Mognetti, Co-Founder and CEO of CoinShares commented: &ldquo;Receiving MiCA authorisation from the AMF is a pivotal milestone, not just for CoinShares, but for the entire European digital asset industry. For too long, asset managers operating in crypto have been confined to partial or improvised regulatory frameworks. With MiCA, we now have a clear, harmonised structure across the EU, and CoinShares is proud to be the first in continental Europe to meet that standard as a fully regulated asset manager.</p>
<p>This authorisation sends a strong signal: crypto is here to stay and it belongs within a professional, transparent, and investor-centric regulatory environment. CoinShares has always believed that innovation and regulation can go hand in hand. As a publicly listed company, our commitment to governance, accountability, and excellence is now matched by a regulatory foundation that enables us to serve our clients across all asset classes, from traditional to digital.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Unique Market Position</h4>
<p>The comprehensive regulatory framework positions the Group as the only firm in continental Europe capable of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing genuine professional active management services across both traditional and digital assets </li>
<li>Offering services through clients' preferred platforms with proper segregation of custody and management duties </li>
<li>Delivering institutional-grade portfolio management with EU regulatory oversight </li>
<li>Serving as a regulated counterparty for institutional investors requiring compliance with fiduciary standards</li>
</ul>

<title>DGCX Reports Strong H1 2025 Performance With Over 1 Million Contracts, Led By Increased Gold And INR Quanto Futures Demand</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dgcx-reports-strong-h1-2025-performance-with-over-1-million-contracts-led-by-in-2025723/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><em><b>DGCX trades over 1 million contracts in H1 2025, a 30% increase in daily volumes year-on-year&nbsp;</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>Spot gold contract volume soars nearly 200% by value traded year-on-year</b></em></li>
<li><em><b>INR Quanto contract sees heightened activity amid regional hedging demand</b></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The Dubai Gold and Commodities Exchange (DGCX) has announced a robust performance in the first half of 2025, with over 1 million contracts traded by the end of June, marking a 30% year-on-year increase in average daily volumes. The strong performance reflects the heightened demand for hedging instruments amid global market volatility, with gold contracts and the INR Quanto product leading the uptick in trading activity.</p>
<p>The standout performer of the period was DGCX&rsquo;s Shariah-compliant Gold Spot Contract (DGSG), which saw the value of trades increase from USD 15.6 million in H1 2024 to USD 46.8 million in H1 2025 &ndash; a remarkable 199.84% year-on-year increase. In volume terms, DGSG contracts rose 118% in the 12 months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The INR Quanto futures contract, a synthetic contract that enables global market participants to hedge Indian rupee exposure against the US dollar without requiring access to the underlying Indian markets, continued to attract strong trading interest. This growing popularity signifies its importance as a regional risk management tool amid ongoing FX market fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, DGCX</strong>, said: &ldquo;DGCX has seen exceptional momentum in the first half of the year, with nearly USD 47 million traded through our spot gold contract alone &ndash; a 200% year-on-year increase &ndash; and a 30% rise in daily volumes across the exchange driven by demand for DGSG and INR Quanto futures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This performance not only places DGCX firmly on course to surpass its 2024 results but reinforces its role as a critical pillar in the region&rsquo;s financial infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As global market conditions grow more complex, the exchange&rsquo;s rising adoption by Shariah-based investors, bullion traders, and institutional participants alike highlights the growing demand and broad appeal for sophisticated, secure, and transparent hedging tools &ndash; a position we expect will get stronger as we continue to reinforce Dubai&rsquo;s standing as a world-class centre for commodities and derivatives trading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Part of DMCC&rsquo;s dedicated support for the precious metals industry, DGCX plays a pivotal role in Dubai&rsquo;s status as one of the world&rsquo;s largest trading hubs for gold. With over 1,500 member companies operating in the gold and precious metals sector within DMCC, the exchange complements the international district&rsquo;s broader offering in physical and financial trading infrastructure.</p>
<p>The strong H1 2025 performance builds on DGCX&rsquo;s full-year 2024 results, which saw 1.56 million contracts traded with a notional value exceeding USD 37 billion. The exchange is well on track to surpass that figure in 2025, reinforcing its position as the region&rsquo;s leading derivatives marketplace.</p>

<title>AI: A Blueprint For Better Banking? Keynote Address By ASIC Chair Joe Longo At The ABA Banking Conference In Sydney On 23 July 2025</title>

<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>ASIC won't hold back customer-centric AI innovation, but cutting-edge technology can&rsquo;t leave your customers bleeding.</li>
<li>We all have a duty to harness the technological advances we are seeing - and use them for community and customer benefit.</li>
<li>We are not rushing to more AI regulation but acknowledge more regulation may be needed in future. In the meantime, regulators will need to be bolder and more imaginative with how we use our existing powers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for that introduction. Before I start my formal remarks, I would like to begin by acknowledging the Traditional Owners, the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation, and their ongoing connection to and custodianship of the lands on which we meet today, and to pay my respects to elders past and present. I extend that respect to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons present.</p>
<p>Of course, the other important acknowledgement is Anna Bligh [outgoing Australian Banking Association Chief Executive Officer]. Anna, you&rsquo;re going to have to be putting up with this for the next two days. But seriously, you&rsquo;ve been a committed and constructive leader of the ABA, particularly during a transformational period for the banking sector. We won&rsquo;t go over the history again but I am particularly grateful on behalf of ASIC for the collaborative way you have engaged with us on so many fronts. I won&rsquo;t try to summarise them but including most recently on one of my pet projects, which of course is regulatory simplification, otherwise known as deregulation. You&rsquo;ve gone to three meetings, you&rsquo;ve done some great work for us there and I look forward to continuing that work with the ABA under the leadership of Simon Birmingham. Simon - welcome. I look forward to working with you as well.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>&lsquo;AI has been around now for 75 years or so. In the first few decades, breakthroughs came every 5-10 years. Now they seem to be emerging every 6 to 12 months, some as technological innovations, others as dramatic new applications. [&hellip;] My view is that we will be basking in an AI summer for the foreseeable future.&rsquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>
<p>So writes Richard Susskind in his recent book on&nbsp;<em>How To Think About AI: A guide for the perplexed.</em>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve read this book and I have to tell you, I&rsquo;m still perplexed. However, we would both go further.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that AI represents one of the most momentous and significant areas of change in today&rsquo;s world. Like any tool, of course, it can be used well or badly. The opportunities presented by AI, particularly when it comes to customer service, are undeniable. But with every new opportunity comes new risk, and so AI is also an opportunity to reflect on how you can keep serving your customers.</p>
<p>In short, I believe AI is both a catalyst for a new era in customer-centric banking &ndash; and a reminder that customer-centric is exactly what banking ought to be about. It&rsquo;s both sides of this coin that I&rsquo;ll be addressing today.</p>
<h2>AI &ndash; its perception and opportunities</h2>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s consider AI as we know it today. By that I don&rsquo;t mean the state or progress of its development &ndash; that would be a risky undertaking which would likely become obsolete before my remarks have even ended! Instead, I mean to look at how AI is perceived by everyday Australians, and the opportunities it presents for better banking.</p>
<p>I start with perception, because perception precedes adoption of technology. When Christopher Sholes and his associates invented the typewriter in the 1860s, they struggled to get financial backing for it and almost went bankrupt. Why? Because the perception was that there was no need for it &ndash; what would all those stenographers do with all their time? A similar story is told about the invention of the sewing machine.</p>
<p>The point is that without the trust of the customer, technological developments can struggle to make progress. You could have the best technology in the world, but if people don&rsquo;t trust it, they&rsquo;re not going to use it.</p>
<p>And trust is what seems to be missing. The latest research by RepTrak and KPMG shows that over the last 12 months, Australians&rsquo; trust in AI has declined.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&nbsp;Australians have lower levels of AI use, training, and confidence than their peers around the world. Five out of 10 Australians use AI &ndash; but fewer than four out of 10 (36%) trust it.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&nbsp;The number of Australians who think that AI doesn&rsquo;t improve customer service or the way businesses are run has also risen since last year.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>
<p>This is a problem, because we&rsquo;re hearing a lot of talk right now about AI as the &lsquo;next big lever for economic growth&rsquo;. Much has been said recently about Australia&rsquo;s &lsquo;productivity problem&rsquo;. Our labour productivity growth has halved in the past two decades<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>. Low productivity is not an abstract number on a page. It&rsquo;s people working more but feeling they&rsquo;re getting less. It&rsquo;s everything getting more expensive but not better.</p>
<p>The promise of AI is that it can raise living standards, and &lsquo;deliver a significant productivity boost&rsquo; with &lsquo;higher real wages and more opportunities for more Australians.&rsquo;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&nbsp;But this can only happen when Australian workers embrace it - rather than feel that AI is being imposed on them.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>
<p>So the perception is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, we have business leaders across a range of industries singing AI&rsquo;s praises, opportunities, and potential &ndash; while on the other hand, the number of Australians who distrust the technology appears to be growing.</p>
<p>This might sound like a problem &ndash; but I would suggest that, in financial services, and in the banking sector in particular, it is instead an opportunity for industry to shift community perception.</p>
<p>Banks are some of the most sophisticated operators in Australian business &ndash; and if anyone has the systems, technology, and processes to lead Australia&rsquo;s AI revolution, it&rsquo;s all of you. You have been using machine-learning for years and already have some of the necessary governance structures in place. You have teams of data scientists, and the infrastructure to support technological advances. And, since Australians interact with their banks in some form or other every day &ndash; if you get AI right, that will go a long way toward addressing Australians&rsquo; general hesitation around AI.</p>
<p>The good news is, we&rsquo;re already seeing a boldness in the banking sector to move beyond the basics. A cursory flick through the news shows how AI is already being used to solve genuine customer problems in our biggest banks.</p>
<p>Look at Westpac piloting AI to help its scam and fraud support team process and analyse information provided by customers about potential incidents, by providing live transcripts, or alerts when key indicators are detected.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>
<p>Or NAB using AI to find &lsquo;needles in a haystack&rsquo; and assessing customer complaints for issues that could become systemic problems.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or CBA beating scammers at their own game by unleashing an army of &lsquo;bots&rsquo; who sound like real people &ndash; Australian accents and all &ndash; to tie them up on lengthy phone calls, thereby preventing them from contacting real people<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-10"><sup>[10]</sup></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here, I want to acknowledge for a moment Macquarie University&rsquo;s Cyber Security Hub Executive Director Professor Dali Kaafar, who first conceived of and developed this technology. It is wonderful to see Dr Kafaar&rsquo;s genius and persistence come to fruition in a way that will no doubt help many, many Australian consumers.</p>
<h2>Do we need more regulation?</h2>
<p>So, all this is very promising &ndash; and very exciting. And as the theme of this conference highlights, it&rsquo;s also likely to be disruptive in terms of how banking is done.</p>
<p>Which leads me to the question people often ask me: Do we need more regulation around AI, to ensure it is adopted safely and wisely?</p>
<p>My position &ndash; and ASIC&rsquo;s &ndash; is that we should not rush into more AI regulation.</p>
<p>First, because our existing laws are technology-neutral. In essence, some guard rails already exist &ndash; and ASIC will enforce them as they stand.</p>
<p>An important example is the obligations of directors under the C<em>orporations Act</em>, which apply broadly &ndash; and as companies increasingly deploy AI, that use of AI is one of a range of issues that directors must pay attention to, as part of their existing duties.</p>
<p>Second, the reality is, as I have said publicly before, the more specific and narrowly targeted regulation becomes, the more complex it becomes. It gets harder to understand, harder to comply with, and harder for regulators to enforce.</p>
<p>This becomes a burden borne by everyone &ndash; legislators, policymakers, businesses big and small, regulators, and consumers and investors. It&rsquo;s played out across the economy in lost time and productivity. The mosaic of complexity also impacts what matters to consumers &ndash; including how we combat scams, predatory lending, and unfair contracts. And it becomes a handbrake on innovation, when you have got to spend more on compliance lawyers than coders.</p>
<p>So, while we're not rushing to new regulation, that&rsquo;s not to say that new regulation won&rsquo;t be needed.</p>
<p>To borrow again from Richard Susskind, &lsquo;one clear practical issue is that we simply cannot roll out our entire policy making apparatus every time there is a major new advance in AI. As the new developments come at us at an ever-increasing pace, we will have neither the time nor the capacity&rsquo;.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the challenge. We have yet to create the regulatory architecture, language, or strategy that will enable us to regulate confidently and in real time a group of technologies that is evolving as rapidly as we&rsquo;re seeing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, regulators will need to be bolder and more imaginative about how we use our existing powers. You can count on ASIC on that. In other words, we&rsquo;ve got to kick the tyres a bit and see just how far our existing technology-neutral framework will flex.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already apparent that AI could present some challenges for regulators in data and information gathering. That could, in theory, stretch and test our ability to identify and assess systemic harms. These are bridges we are yet to cross but they are certainly looming.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we don&rsquo;t want regulation to have a chilling effect on AI innovation and the potential benefits that it would have for all of us.</p>
<h2>Will you get in trouble?</h2>
<p>So, while we are grappling with the question of what new regulation might need to look like, you might ask: &lsquo;Will we get in trouble in the meantime?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a legitimate concern, given that ASIC&rsquo;s review last year of 23 AFS and credit licensees that were using or planning to use AI found a number of gaps in how they assessed risks to consumers from AI. For some licensees, their governance arrangements lagged well behind their AI use.<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>
<p>ASIC is continuing to monitor how entities are using AI, and we will take enforcement action where appropriate, where we see misconduct occurring. So yes, you will get in trouble when technology is not used responsibly. Which then leads us to the question, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the benchmark for good AI innovation?&rsquo;</p>
<p>And I think the answer is pretty clear: good AI innovation keeps the customer front and centre.</p>
<p>What does this look like? In essence, it involves using AI to better serve the customer.</p>
<p>ASIC will soon be releasing the follow-up to our&nbsp;<em>Better Banking for Indigenous Consumers&nbsp;</em>report, which will address the impact of fee harm to low-income customers nationwide. Millions of dollars of bank fees are being refunded to customers as a result of this work, with a significant number of eligible people being migrated into low-fee accounts.</p>
<p>It would be a true win for customer-centric banking if your algorithm prompted you to serve your customers better before an ASIC report did.</p>
<p>If it had, maybe people like Cassie &ndash; not her real name &ndash; a single mother from South Australia, would not have been charged more than $2,600 in overdraw fees over five years. To put that into perspective, that&rsquo;s equivalent to 13 and a half 8-hour days at the minimum wage.</p>
<p>Or Charlotte (again not her real name), a jobseeker from Western Australia, might not have accrued over $4,000 in dishonour fees over the same period.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s great that these refunds are being made, and that the systemic issues identified in our Better Banking report are being addressed.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/speeches/ai-a-blueprint-for-better-banking/#fn-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a>&nbsp;But isn&rsquo;t it disappointing that people like Cassie and Charlotte had to wait for that report to see a positive change in their lives?</p>
<p>So, my question to everyone&nbsp; in this room is this - what are you doing to ensure people like Cassie and Charlotte are better protected and supported in the future? Is AI going to be part of the answer?</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: cutting-edge technology can&rsquo;t leave your customers bleeding. We&rsquo;ve already seen that customer trust in AI and its potential to improve customer service is eroding. If banks get this wrong, we&rsquo;re likely to see a significant setback in AI legitimacy and trust.</p>
<p>Talking up the benefits of AI must be accompanied by showing customers how it makes their lives better. And more than that - AI innovation has to actually make your customers&rsquo; lives better and not just be a marketing or data-gathering tool. And that requires careful attention to ethics when introducing these systems to ensure customers actually benefit over the long term.</p>
<p>Many of the innovations I mentioned earlier are good examples of AI systems for consumer benefit. We all have a duty to harness the technological advances we are seeing - and use them for the benefit of the community and customers.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, AI is an opportunity to reinforce your focus on customer-centric banking.</p>
<p>If done well, AI adoption and digital transformation can be a blueprint for better banking. ASIC won&rsquo;t hold back customer-centric AI innovation.</p>
<p>But, don&rsquo;t be complacent and don&rsquo;t forget - the customer must be at the centre of everything that you do &ndash; and ASIC will be watching.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee Meeting, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, July 22, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-sec-2025722/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-sec-2025722/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. It is a pleasure, as always, to be at today&rsquo;s meeting of the Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Today the Committee takes up the topic of &ldquo;finders,&rdquo; and their role in fundraising for private small businesses. As we&rsquo;ve heard already, in 2020 the Commission proposed &ndash; but did not adopt &ndash; an exemption from broker-registration requirements for two tiers of finders operating in the private markets.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;The proposal effectively created new categories of unregistered, unsupervised financial professionals, who could engage in traditional brokerage solicitation activities without having to satisfy the regulatory requirements imposed on brokers.</p>
<p>Some in this room may recall that I opposed the proposal. I would like to reiterate some of the concerns I (and Commissioner Lee) had at the time &ndash; and I continue to have today &ndash; as you discuss this topic and consider any future recommendation.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span><i>Investor Protection Concerns</i></span></p>
<p><i>First</i>, we checked important investor protections at the door. The 2020 proposal did not attempt to marry the finder registration exemption with effective guardrails. If the Commission is to engage in policymaking that relaxes registration requirements on finders, then it must consider more than just the potential for issuer access to capital; due consideration must be given to the investor experience.</p>
<p>The 2020 proposal would have allowed finders to: contact potential investors; distribute offering materials; pitch those materials in meetings with issuers and investors; and effectively praise the benefits of that issuer (without expressly &ldquo;advising&rdquo; on the investment) &ndash; all in exchange for compensation premised on whether they make the sale.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;This is traditional broker activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>If the Commission allows finders to engage in traditional broker activity without registration - or even with diminished regulatory responsibilities &ndash; we must build in guardrails. The 2020 proposal eschewed broker requirements under Regulation Best Interest<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;(even though the Commission had just made clear in 2019 that Regulation Best Interest applies to accredited investors);<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;it also sidelined books and records, basic sales practice, and examination requirements, among other things.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;The proposal did not even require finders to notify the Commission of their intent to utilize the exemption. Finders were essentially carved out of our registration regime without any mechanism for us to review whether they were complying with the requirements of the safe harbor, or to evaluate the success of the program.</p>
<p>The need for guardrails is important as the Commission considers expanding access to the opaque private markets, whose securities are less liquid, bear higher transaction costs, and whose valuation practices are less consistent (to name a few potential issues).</p>
<p>But, perhaps more importantly, the need for protections is even greater<span><i>&nbsp;</i></span>in this finders&rsquo; space which &ndash; again and again &ndash; has proven itself susceptible to microcap fraud, pump-and-dumps, front-end-fee scams, and other manipulative activity.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Indeed, experts have noted that the enforcement actions and litigations exposing finder-related fraud likely represent only &ldquo;the tip of the iceberg.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p>This cannot be an unprotected space.</p>
<p>Further, any effort to limit oversight to anti-fraud provisions &ndash; as was proposed in 2020 &ndash; would be a mistake. We cannot strip ourselves of the tools required to detect fraud in the first place, such as examination or books and records requirements. Without these protections, I fear fraud will either go undiscovered or only exposed when investor funds are too far gone to be recovered.</p>
<p><span><i>The Importance of Empirical Analysis</i></span></p>
<p><i>Second</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>any Commission action in this arena should be done through notice-and-comment rulemaking &ndash; including an economic analysis that explores the impact that any proposal will have on efficiency, competition and capital formation based on empirical data. It should also include a fulsome historical perspective on the success and usefulness of finders to date. Empirical, data-driven analysis will allow for more nuanced policy-making that &ndash; to the first point &ndash; allows us to better tailor any potential expansion in finder activity with appropriately calibrated investor and market protections.</p>
<p><span><i>And&hellip;Regulatory Purpose</i></span></p>
<p><i>Third,&nbsp;</i>and relatedly, the data we look at as part of any rulemaking should reflect the difference between mere capital raising and actual capital formation. As I was refreshing myself on the 2020 proposal, I was reminded of something that former Commissioner Luis Aguilar said about capital formation, which is of course one of the pillars of our mission. &ldquo;Capital formation,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is much more than just capital raising. By itself, selling a bond or a share of stock doesn&rsquo;t add a thing to the real economy, no matter how quickly or cheaply you do it. True capital formation requires that the capital raised be invested in productive assets - like a factory, store or new technology &ndash; or otherwise used to make a business more productive. The more productive those assets are, the greater the capital formation from the investment &ndash; and, importantly, the more jobs created.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/crenshaw-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>I hope you keep this in mind as you think about capital formation today. Will relaxing the regulations around finders in fact ease burdens of true, meaningful capital formation?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your always-thoughtful deliberations. I look forward to today&rsquo;s insights.</p>

<title>Remarks At The Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee Meeting, Paul S. Atkins, SEC Chairman, July 22, 2025</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-at-the-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-paul-2025722/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. Let me begin by thanking all of you for being here and for your dedicated efforts. As I mentioned at our previous meeting, this Committee serves a critical function. Its members come from every corner of the country and represent a remarkably broad cross-section of investors, innovators, and advisers. I am grateful for your ongoing work to elevate the voices of America&rsquo;s entrepreneurs. And I am excited to discuss important policy matters related to the Commission&rsquo;s role in facilitating capital formation.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Today, this Committee will continue its discussion of potential enhancements to Regulation A and then engage in a deep dive on finders, who fill an essential void in the entrepreneurial ecosystem by identifying, and in certain circumstances soliciting, potential investors.</p>
<p>We know small businesses seeking to raise less than $5 million in capital can struggle to attract funding from VC firms and institutions.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Larger investors are often inclined to step in at later stages of growth, leaving fledgling businesses and their founders with limited avenues to capital. So, after exhausting their own network of family members and friends, businesses in the earliest stage of growth sometimes engage a finder to identify angel investors who target smaller, higher-risk investment opportunities. These finders may provide valuable introductions and facilitate access to much-needed capital. But the regulatory approach to this limited activity, when done outside of a registered broker-dealer, is quite opaque.</p>
<p>Commission staff have issued no-action letters over the years addressing very narrow circumstances under which persons have sought to act as finders without registering as a broker-dealer.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;Gray areas remain. And a lack of regulatory certainty can deter conscientious participants from helping small businesses to secure financing at a formative stage.</p>
<p>So understandably, many have called on the Commission to provide greater clarity over the years. In 2017, the Treasury Department recommended that the SEC work with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the states to formulate a new regulatory structure.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;The SEC proposed an exemptive order with a request for comment in October 2020<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;but has since taken no further action. And the legal gray area that lingers can deprive small businesses of essential resources at a time when thirty-three percent of them launch with less than $5,000 in funding&mdash;and nearly forty percent fail due to lack of capital.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s more, when regulatory uncertainty stands in the way of investment, it&rsquo;s not just capital that dries up, but jobs and ingenuity. Small businesses employ nearly half of America&rsquo;s workforce and represent an equal share of our GDP.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;They create almost two out of every three new jobs.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/remarks-atkins-small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee-meeting-072225#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;And they exemplify a spirit of dynamism that has made America a place where a single idea sparked in a garage or a storefront can scale into something extraordinary. That&rsquo;s why discussions like this one matter&mdash;and it&rsquo;s why I am grateful for the chance to listen, to learn, and to work together toward a smarter, more sensible approach that can further catalyze capital formation for entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">***</p>
<p>Now, as we consider how to connect more small businesses with early-stage investors, I have been asked if, given the goal of revitalizing initial public offerings (IPOs), a clearer framework for finders would be counterproductive. Ultimately, companies that would benefit from a finder are seeking early-round seed funding, not the heavy capital infusion that an IPO can provide. Nevertheless, it is important that any recommendations that this Committee makes regarding finders do not risk further cannibalizing the public markets. And I encourage this Committee to keep that objective in mind as it explores regulatory solutions.</p>
<p>At the same time, we must be attuned to the distinct headwinds small businesses face and work to unlock, rather than undermine, capital raising in a manner consistent with the SEC&rsquo;s mission. Our task, as well as our responsibility, is to ensure that the agency&rsquo;s regulatory framework keeps pace with their ambition. And as we begin today&rsquo;s meeting, I&rsquo;m confident that the insights and recommendations put forth by this Committee can help us do so.</p>
<p>So, I&rsquo;d like to thank you once again for being here today. I very much welcome your perspectives, including those of our two presenters. And I look forward to a productive discussion ahead. Thank you.</p>

<title>Bank Of England: Results Of The Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC) Turnover Survey For April 2025</title>

<div class="page-content page-carousel sc-500c2bbe52444851bf571058b1d98926">
<p>In April 2025, 25 financial institutions active in the UK foreign exchange (FX) market participated in the semi-annual turnover survey for the Foreign Exchange Joint Standing Committee (FXJSC). The survey results are summarised below. Detailed tables for the April 2025 reporting period are available separately.</p>
<p>The main findings of the survey are:</p>
<ul>
<li>During April 2025, uncertainty surrounding global trade policies led to high levels of activity and volatility across financial markets, including FX. The average daily UK FX turnover reached a record high of $4,045 billion, representing a 26% increase relative to turnover recorded in the October 2024 survey. This constituted the largest survey-on-survey increase since 2013.&nbsp;</li>
<li>On a year-on-year basis, FX turnover in April 2025 increased by 20%, when compared to the April 2024 survey.</li>
<li>Growth across instruments was broad, but mainly led by spot which increased by 42% compared to the October 2024 survey to $1,293 billion. FX swaps increased to $1,563 billion, up by 11% in comparison to the October 2024 survey and remained the most traded instrument by volume. FX options volumes reached $350 billion, up 52% from the October 2024 survey.</li>
<li>Market share of the top three traded currency pairs: EUR/USD, USD/JPY and GBP/USD remained broadly in line with previous surveys. EUR/USD continued to be the most traded currency pair in London, with an average daily turnover of $1,010 billion, making up 25% of overall FX turnover in April 2025.</li>
<li>Since April 2008, overall FX turnover has risen steadily from $1,815 billion to $4,045 billion.&nbsp;</li>

<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The FXJSC was established in November 1973 and is a forum for market participants, infrastructure providers and the relevant UK public authorities to discuss conjunctural and structural issues concerning the wholesale foreign exchange (FX) market in the UK and the associated supporting infrastructure. The FXJSC currently has two sub committees.<ol>
<li>The Operations Sub-Committee was established in 2002. Its members are operations managers from many major banks active in the London wholesale FX market, as well as representatives from service providers, trade associations and from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</li>
<li>The Legal Sub-Committee was established in 2004 and comprises legal professionals providing in-house counsel for many of the major institutions involved in the wholesale FX market in London and representatives from the FCA.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>While the data presented here is of a similar nature to that collected by the BIS Triennial Survey, the FXJSC data is collected more frequently. In addition, the basis of reporting for the FXJSC Turnover Survey is the location of the price-setting dealer, whereas the basis of reporting in the BIS Triennial Survey is the location of the sales desk.</li>
<li>Preliminary results for the April 2025 BIS triennial survey are expected in September 2025. See the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/bis-survey/2022">April 2022 BIS Triennial Survey results</a>.</li>

<p>The Bank of England and the FCA (the authorities) co-operate on the supervision of financial market infrastructures (FMIs). The authorities consulted with FMIs to assess how that co-operation is working.</p>
<p>Following the responses, the authorities have concluded that the arrangements for co-operation remain effective with appropriate coordination and no material duplication. Both authorities remain aware that, through efficient coordination, we can improve the effectiveness by which we supervise firms.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The company, the eighth company to join BME's growth markets so far this year, starts with a valuation of 20 million euros</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The BME Scaleup Management Committee has approved the incorporation of Inmobiliaria Marbella SOCIMI on July 24, once all the documentation submitted by the company has been analysed and studied and a favourable evaluation report has been issued by the Market Coordination and Incorporations Committee.</p>
<p>The company's Board of Directors, which is the eighth company to join BME's growth markets, has taken a reference price of 4 euros per share as a reference for the start of trading, taking into account the valuation report prepared by an independent expert, which represents a total value of the company of 20 million euros.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company's trading code will be &lsquo;SCIMS&rsquo;. The company's Registered Adviser Renta 4 Sigrun.</p>
<p>Inmobiliaria Marbella is a family-owned company that has been operating since 1984 and is dedicated to real estate development, sales, and property rentals, primarily focused on the province of M&aacute;laga, Spain. The Company's model is based on maximising income from long-term rentals, as well as the profitability of its owned assets, offering investors the opportunity to invest in real assets of various types in the Spanish real estate market with minimal possible risk.</p>
<p>The Inmobiliaria Marbella&rsquo;s Information Document is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx" target="_blank">BME Scaleup website<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>, where you can find all the information about the company and its business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BME&rsquo;s growth markets (BME Growth and BME Scaleup) are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2024, these markets welcomed 23 new companies and now have more than 150 companies listed for trading.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx" target="_blank">BME Growth<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>&nbsp;allows small-cap companies from all sectors, with a significant presence of technology companies, to finance their growth, with recurring access to capital increases and a broad base of national and international investors. For its part,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx" target="_blank">BME Scaleup<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>&nbsp;is especially oriented towards scaleups, although it is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, REITs, or family businesses. This market adapts to the needs of these companies by relaxing the incorporation requirements while offering the necessary transparency to investors. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, reputation, visibility, a boost to inorganic growth, and greater ease in attracting and retaining talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these growth markets, BME completes its service offering. BME has a market for every type of company, from the first approaches to capital markets with the formation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/ing/Home" target="_blank">Pre-Market Environment<span class="cmp-link__screen-reader-only">opens in a new tab</span></a>, to large companies listed on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Finders/Seekers: Exemption Features, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, Washington D.C., July 22, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you to the Committee members for your continued service and to today&rsquo;s speakers. In this morning&rsquo;s follow-up discussion on Regulation A, please continue to provide your candid views about what changes could make Regulation A a more effective capital-raising tool. The discussion at the last meeting, as you thought through different aspects of Regulation A, already has helped to inform my thinking. I am looking forward to seeing your recommendations on the topic.</p>
<p>Later this morning, the Committee will be thinking about a common marketplace question that frustrates founders and investors alike: &ldquo;where is what I&rsquo;m looking for?&rdquo; A founder with a product is looking for an angel investor or venture capitalist with a compatible investment philosophy. Simultaneously, an investor with capital to allocate is looking for a company with a vision that resonates with her. Time spent looking for one another is a mutually incurred transaction cost that hampers the growth of individual businesses and the broader economy. One part of the Commission&rsquo;s three-part mission is to ensure fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Ensuring efficient markets means creating a regulatory environment that facilitates, rather than impedes, the coming together of entrepreneurs and investors.</p>
<p>Finders play a crucial role, particularly for small businesses, by connecting entrepreneurs and investors. Finders often are engaged just as much in social behavior as they are in economic behavior. As a result, well-intentioned friends, colleagues, and industry acquaintances may find themselves unwittingly acting as broker-dealers and therefore subject to an onerous regulatory framework ill-suited for the connections and introductions these individuals facilitate. Companies, on the other hand, also face uncertainty in knowing when they can engage a finder that is not registered as a broker-dealer to help locate investors. Despite these consequences, the Commission has failed to provide clarity in this area, which has forced finders and companies to rely on highly fact-specific no-action letters from Commission staff. This lack of clarity has persisted for so long it transcends committees; this Committee&rsquo;s predecessor, the Advisory Committee on Small and Emerging Companies, lamented that, &ldquo;[t]here is significant uncertainty in the marketplace about what activities require broker-dealer registration.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;And this Committee too has asked for years for the Commission to adopt a framework to permit finders to engage in limited capital raising activities involving accredited investors.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Finally, in October 2020 the Commission proposed an exemptive order which would have permitted natural persons to engage in certain limited activities on behalf of issuers without registering as brokers (the &ldquo;2020 Proposal&rdquo;).<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;A month later, this Committee provided helpful feedback.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&nbsp;Commenters caused me to question the proposed approach, which involved two tiers of finders. As one commenter explained with respect to proposed Tier 1 finders, &ldquo;limiting them to one transaction annually and prohibiting them from having&nbsp;<span>any</span>&nbsp;contact with an investor makes the category virtually useless.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;Though the 2020 Proposal was never adopted, as you consider the staff&rsquo;s overview of the 2020 Proposal and discuss issues surrounding finders more generally, please consider the following questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the 2020 Proposal a good starting point for exemptive relief, or would a different approach be more effective? Have market practices changed since 2020 in a way that would warrant changes to the 2020 Proposal?</li>
<li>Would the 2020 Proposal, or any action related to providing clarity for finders, benefit from a full rulemaking process, as some commenters suggested in 2020?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></li>
<li>Is the Committee still supportive of a blanket exemption for finders for offerings under a certain size?<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></li>
<li>Should any exemption for finders cover activities related to secondary offerings?</li>
<li>In 2020 commenters were divided on whether an exemption should be provided only to natural persons.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-remarks-sbcfac-072225?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;Does this committee favor one approach over the other?</li>
</ol>
<p>I look forward to hearing how today&rsquo;s discussion builds on the previous work of the Committee.</p>

<title>Statement On The Departure Of PCAOB Chair Erica Y. Williams, SEC Commissioner Caroline A. Crenshaw, July 22, 2025</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Today, Erica Williams steps down as the Chair of the PCAOB. While I was disheartened last week to read of her compelled resignation, I am nothing but grateful for her exemplary service and stewardship of the PCAOB. Chair Williams has served the Board, the Commission, the investing public and markets with honor and distinction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her tenure, the PCAOB has updated, refined and modernized auditing standards and rules, and improved overall audit quality; sharpened the inspections program and helped reduce deficiencies across audit firms; and, effectively held wrongdoers to account, helping to deter future bad actors and making our markets safer for investment. It has overseen inspections in over 50 jurisdictions around the world &ndash; including for the first time in China. And, the Board has made firm inspection reports more useful, and accelerated their publication, to the benefit of investors, audit committees, and the markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chair Williams has also been a leader and a mentor to the PCAOB&rsquo;s deeply talented and irreplaceably expert staff, who I know will sorely miss her unwavering, tenacious advocacy on their behalf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PCAOB has a singular mission &ndash; to regulate the audits of public companies and SEC-registered brokers and dealers in order to protect investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate, and independent audit reports. Chair Williams and her staff have carried out this mission with grace, integrity and with clear, unwavering purpose. Our markets are more robust and reliable for their service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On behalf of myself and the millions of investors who have benefitted from your commitment and dedication &ndash; thank you, Chair Williams.</p>
<p>To Board Member Botic, who tomorrow steps into some big shoes, I wish you the best of luck.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning, and welcome to the Federal Reserve Board. I am pleased, though not surprised, to see such great interest in the topic of today's conference&mdash;the integrated review of the capital framework for large banks. I want to thank Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman for having the great idea of holding this event at the outset of her term. I would also like to thank Fed staff for their tireless work in putting the conference together.</p>
<p>Today we will hear the perspectives of industry veterans, academics, and current and former policymakers who are all well-versed in the operations of large banks and the main pillars of the capital framework. A great benefit of this conference is the chance to consider all elements of the capital framework in concert, rather than look at each in isolation. We need to ensure that all the different pieces of the capital framework work together effectively. Doing so will help maintain a safe, sound, and efficient banking system, for the benefit of the people we serve. The U.S. bank capital framework includes risk-based capital requirements, leverage requirements, the surcharge for the largest and most complex banks, and the stress tests. We will discuss the status of each of those elements, and the road ahead, in a comprehensive manner. As this audience will know, we have proposals outstanding or in the works across all four areas.</p>
<p>Our regulatory capital framework and all banking rules are implemented through supervision, an area where Vice Chair for Supervision Bowman brings deep experience as a former banker and state supervisor. As she has noted, we need to make sure that our supervisory practices focus on the critical areas that determine safety and soundness. We need our large banks to be well capitalized and to manage their key risks well. And we need large banks to be free to compete with one another, with nonbank financial firms, and with banks in other jurisdictions to provide capital and support economic growth.</p>
<p>The Fed is a dynamic institution. We are open to hearing new ideas and feedback on how to improve the capital framework for large banks, and I look forward to hearing from today's participants. Thank you again for joining us today.</p>

<title>DTCC’s Comment On Canada's Amended Trade Reporting Rules</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-comment-on-canadas-amended-trade-reporting-rules-2025722/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/dtccs-comment-on-canadas-amended-trade-reporting-rules-2025722/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Michele Hillery, Head of Repository &amp; Derivatives Services (RDS) at DTCC, shared her insights on the implementation of Canada&rsquo;s amended trade reporting rules. These updates bring substantial changes to the country&rsquo;s reporting standards, marking a significant shift in regulatory requirements.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) amended trade reporting rules (Canada Rewrite) have been successfully implemented by DTCC&rsquo;s Global Trade Repository (GTR) service, through its locally designated/recognized trade repository, DTCC Data Repository (U.S.) LLC (DDR), across all thirteen Canadian provinces and territories. The updated requirements closely align with CFTC reporting standards, marking an important step toward greater regulatory alignment, supporting transparency and improved data quality in the global derivatives marketplace. Notable changes in the Canada Rewrite include various new Critical Data Element fields, UPI for Credits, Rates, Equities, and FX, and the addition of collateral reporting requirements for dealers.</i></p>
<p><i>As the industry continues to adjust to these Canadian reporting changes, firms are encouraged to engage with DTCC. For those seeking additional guidance, DTCC Consulting Services is prepared to assist firms as they navigate the post-Canada Rewrite landscape and other global regulatory adjustments to support successful implementations.&rdquo;</i></p>

<title>Supporting EU's Energy Infrastructure Through Planning And Financing - ACER Calls For Greater Consistency In European Electricity Network Plans</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>As the EU accelerates its transition to renewable energy, electricity networks must keep pace with rising demand, decentralised generation and growing cross-border flows. Strategic grid investments play an important role in advancing this transition and ensuring a reliable and efficient energy system.</p>
<p>To support this, ACER publishes its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQV1dUAlZTV0wKUwVVHVYLBlcdCw9TVRoCAAMOBAsNDgRTVVAdWQYABAsCBVAdWwANBB0GD1MFGgxWAlYZBVcPDwNVVVIAUloDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Opinion</a>&nbsp;on the alignment between national and EU-level electricity network development plans, highlighting the need for greater consistency.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are electricity network plans?</span></p>
<p>To guide future grid investments, transmission system operators (TSOs) in each Member State regularly prepare national Network Development Plans (NDPs). At the European level, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) publishes the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (EU TYNDP), which addresses cross-border infrastructure needs.</p>
<p>Ensuring consistency between these national and European plans is key for timely and efficient grid development. It also plays an important role in&nbsp;broader EU efforts, including the upcoming&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBCVBVVVNSW0wOVVdaHVZfBAYdU1wBVRoHXQJVBlcGB1AIUFAdWQYABAsCBVAdWwANBB0GD1MFGgxWAlYZBVcPDwNVVVIAUloDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">European Grids Package</a>, aimed at modernising&nbsp;electricity infrastructure and enabling&nbsp;a more integrated energy system.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Key trends identified:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Alignment between national and EU plans improved thanks to strengthened national regulators&rsquo; role, expanded consultations and better coordination on timelines and scenarios.</li>
<li>Misaligned planning cycles, TYNDP projects not reflected in national plans and limited data transparency risk hindering efficient and coordinated grid development.</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtXUw5VVVgCB0wJVFECHVYKDA8dUAwEURoDAVcHVlIBBlRUVFUdWQYABAsCBVAdWwANBB0GD1MFGgxWAlYZBVcPDwNVVVIAUloDRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more.</a></p>

<title>Archax Group Set To Acquire Deutsche Digital Assets, Further Extending EU Footprint - Adds Crypto ETPs To Its Suite Of Digital Asset Products</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>UK based and regulated digital asset exchange, broker and custodian, Archax, is planning to further extend its regulated EU footprint by acquiring Deutsche Digital Assets (DDA), the Germany based digital asset manager. This follows Archax&rsquo;s acquisition last year of Spanish broker KSCM, which was part of the firm&rsquo;s continued ambition to establish the EU and UK&rsquo;s most complete set of digital asset regulated structures, placing the firm in a unique position.</p>
<p>DDA is a German-based asset manager with approximately $70 million AUM, offering crypto ETPs and a suite of institutional products. DDA also has extensive European distribution channels through its active network of European banks and asset managers.</p>
<p>By acquiring DDA, which is licensed under BaFin, Archax extends its EU presence into Germany and France. Specifically, it allows Archax to add to its EU regulatory stack with the addition of Advisory, Distribution, Portfolio Management and Contract Brokerage permissions. This covers the full spectrum of regulated digital asset solutions across Europe and the UK from tokenised funds and securities to active crypto strategies.</p>
<p>With the UK market opening up to crypto Exchange Traded Products (ETPs), per the FCA approving the first UK listings of crypto ETPs for professional investors earlier this year and, with so much global uncertainty potentially contributing too, the role of digital assets is swelling. With the acquisition of DDA, Archax believe they&rsquo;re uniquely positioned to offer comprehensive access to digital assets from native, on-chain crypto via their regulated exchange, to fully institutional-grade crypto ETPs tailored for professional investors.</p>
<p>Alongside crypto, Archax also offers tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) - unlocking new efficiencies and investment opportunities through blockchain technology. This combination of native crypto, institutional ETPs, and tokenized RWAs, positions Archax as one of Europe&rsquo;s leading digital asset platforms.</p>
<p>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax, comments: &ldquo;Archax is an ambitious business, and we believe that our regulatory structure is on the way to becoming one of the most extensive in the digital asset industry, and acquiring DDA furthers that ambition. Germany and France for example, two of the largest and most regulation-driven markets in Europe, are covered via DDA&rsquo;s existing structure and relationships. Hence, I&rsquo;m delighted to see them joining our Archax family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maximilian Lautenschl&auml;ger, Managing Partner at DDA said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known the team at Archax for several years and have always seen how complementary our strengths are. Joining their family creates incredible synergy: we bring deep access to institutional investors across Germany, France, and Switzerland who are actively looking for tokenised products. At the same time, Archax opens the door to the UK market, where crypto ETPs are now gaining momentum among professional and soon, retail investors. The timing couldn&rsquo;t be better. Together, we&rsquo;re building what we believe will become the leading European digital asset champion.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Energy Trading In Brazil Reaches R$49 Billion In 1S2025</title>

<ul>
<li>Alternative energy sources also reach a volume record, with R$ 5.8 billion </li>
<li>June volumes reach R$7.5 billion, the highest amount for the month in history </li>
</ul>
<p>With low precipitation projections, uncertainty, and high volatility, the financial volume of electricity contracts traded in Brazil on 1S2025 grew 15.4% compared to the same period in 2024, reaching R$49 billion, the highest amount ever recorded in a half-year period in the country. The data is from the BBCE, Brazilian OTC energy and the largest trading environment for energy assets and derivatives in the country.</p>
<p>Until then, the highest financial volume traded in a half-year period had occurred in the 2S2024, an emblematic period for the sector due to high volatility. According to Eduardo Rossetti, Executive Director of Commercial, Products, External Communications, and Marketing at BBCE, due to the sensitivity of the model and concerns about curtailment and credit risk, prices are more volatile and in the short-term negotiation challenges more complex.</p>
<p>In total, 221 TWh were transacted in the first half of the year, a 34.8% decrease compared to 1S2024, and a 6.7% decrease compared to the last half of 2024. In total, 41,000 transactions, a decrease of 18.6% and 18.1%, respectively, compared to the previous two half-year periods.</p>
<p>Rossetti said: &ldquo;the values transacted with physical energy assets on BBCE have reached historic levels, and we have seen a reduction in the number of deals closed. Agents have been conducting fewer transactions, but with greater financial volume due to the price of the assets.</p>
<p><b>Record on alternative energy sources</b></p>
<p>Among the highlights of 1S2025 is the volume of alternative energy sources, which totaled 25,500 GWh, an increase of 40.7% compared to 2S2024 and 11% compared to 1S2024. This amount was divided into more than 3,000 contracts and generated R$5.8 billion. "This movement reflects the growth of the Brazilian energy matrix, largely derived from wind and solar sources," says Rossetti.</p>
<p><b>BBCE closes June with record financial volume.</b></p>
<p>June, in line with other months this year, ended with mixed prices and record financial volume for the period. Among the highlights is conventional energy for July delivery, which fluctuated 29.54%, and the August maturity, which reached R$337.83 per MWh.</p>
<p>In June, 30,000 GWh were traded, an increase of 1.6% compared to May of this year and a decrease of 38.1% compared to June 2024. This amount was distributed across 8,295 contracts, a decrease of 29.7% compared to June of last year and an increase of 56.6% compared to May. In total, these contracts totaled R$7.54 billion, an increase of 5% compared to June 2024.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses, has published new research uncovering environmental, economic, and cultural factors that drive Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) progress across the world&rsquo;s exchanges.<br /><br />Drawing on a decade of data from the WFE&rsquo;s annual Sustainability Surveys, the paper,&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Drivers of Exchange Sustainability Development&rdquo;</em>, authored by Dr Kaitao Lin, Senior Financial Economist at the WFE and Dr Ying Liu, Financial Economist at the WFE, provides the first multi-year analysis of what shapes ESG strategies across 66 exchanges in 54 jurisdictions. The findings reflect a complex interplay of jurisdiction-specific factors, from governance quality, education levels, climate exposure, and cultural attitudes.<br /><br />Research key findings:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Governance is a priority:</strong>&nbsp;Exchanges allocate the largest share of their ESG efforts, 39% on average, to governance. This focus is strongest in jurisdictions with high literacy and low corruption.</li>
<li><strong>Sustainability and reputation drive action:</strong>&nbsp;Over the decade, sustainability concerns and reputational motivations consistently ranked as the most powerful drivers of ESG action, with regulatory pressure having grown in influence since 2017.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerating ESG product growth:</strong>&nbsp;The share of exchanges offering sustainability-related products rose from 28% in 2014 to 86% in 2023, driven by rising investor demand and growing environmental imperatives.</li>
<li><strong>Local cultural contexts matter:&nbsp;</strong>Societies in which individuals prioritise a future-oriented perspective over a short-term point of view, are more likely to support ESG innovation. Conversely, risk-averse cultures, and those with high power distance, and those where traditionally masculine values are prioritised, may be slower to adopt ESG initiatives, especially in governance and social efforts.</li>
<li><strong>Domestic environmental factors influence ESG innovation:</strong>&nbsp;Jurisdictions with greater forest cover and higher climate variability are more likely to develop sustainability-related financial products, such as ESG ETFs and indices.</li>
</ul>
<p><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE</strong>, said, &ldquo;We encourage policymakers and regulators to design targeted ESG frameworks that reflect national circumstances. In markets where ESG awareness remains low, public education campaigns, governance reforms, or incentives for sustainable financial practices could stimulate demand and strengthen market readiness. In more advanced or environmentally exposed economies, exchanges are leading sustainability product innovation and ESG data standardisation.&rdquo;<br /><br /><strong>Pedro Gurrola-Perez, Head of Research at the WFE</strong>, said, &ldquo;For exchanges, the results emphasise the need to align ESG strategies with the socio-economic, environmental, and cultural realities of their jurisdictions. Exchanges operating in risk averse societies may need to take a gradual approach when introducing ESG innovations, ensuring that stakeholders perceive these initiatives as credible and low-risk. Conversely, exchanges in jurisdictions with high environmental performance or strong regulatory frameworks may leverage their position to lead in sustainability product innovation, using ESG as a competitive advantage to attract investment and differentiate.&rdquo;<br /><br />Read the full paper&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=e179d65cca&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<title>CLS Unveils Redesigned CLSClearedFX Service; LCH First CCP To Go Live</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CLS, a financial market infrastructure group delivering settlement, processing and data solutions, today announces a redesign of its CLSClearedFX service, with LCH ForexClear as the first central counterparty (CCP) to go live on the service.</p>
<p>CLSClearedFX is a payment-versus-payment settlement service that allows CCPs and their clearing members to effectively mitigate settlement risk when settling cleared FX and derivative trades.</p>
<p>The redesigned service leverages the existing CLSSettlement platform, enabling CCPs to connect and submit bilateral settlement instructions on behalf of their clearing members, integrating their flows into the main CLSSettlement session.</p>
<p>This integration offers CCPs and their clearing members enhanced risk mitigation, significantly improved operational efficiencies, and greater liquidity benefits through a consolidated settlement model. They also benefit from CLSSettlement&rsquo;s resilient settlement model with robust failure management processes.</p>
<p>LCH ForexClear has successfully transitioned to the redesigned CLSClearedFX service, integrating settlements of cleared deliverable FX contracts into the main CLSSettlement session.</p>
<p>By joining this enhanced service, LCH ForexClear and its clearing members can eliminate the need for separate workflows and bifurcated funding, thereby reducing the costs associated with settling cleared trades.</p>
<p><b>Tharidu Gamwara - Managing Director, Business Manager - Global Currencies and Emerging Markets Trading, J.P. Morgan&nbsp;</b>said: &ldquo;CLSSettlement and LCH ForexClear are industry leading post-trade FX solutions. The operational efficiencies derived from both services will be advantageous to our business, offering multiple benefits that come from cleared FX trades being integrated in the main CLSSettlement session through CLSClearedFX.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Matthew May - Global Head of Market Structure and Non-Financial Risk - FX, EM Rates and Commodities, HSBC&nbsp;</b>said: &ldquo;Mitigating risk in the FX market is a major area of focus for our business. As the largest financial market in the world, robust risk mitigation and capital optimization in our FX procedures are vital. With LCH ForexClear joining CLSClearedFX, the benefits of the two services together will be bringing additional efficiency to us and the wider market.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Andrew Cooper, Chief Services Officer, CLS&nbsp;</b>said: &ldquo;CLS has created a more efficient service that will benefit central counterparties such as LCH ForexClear and its clearing members. Our redesigned service offering reflects the broader trend of financial institutions focusing on best practice in mitigating FX settlement risk and increasing efficiencies associated with centrally cleared trades. The new service demonstrates benefits we can offer to the wider FX marketplace by leveraging our unique position as a financial market infrastructure and collaborating with established service providers that share the same client base.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Andrew Batchelor, Head of ForexClear, LCH&nbsp;</b>commented: &ldquo;LCH ForexClear was developed in response to customer demand for solutions that mitigate counterparty credit risk and provide improved financial resource efficiencies. ForexClear and CLS operating under the new redesigned service, will be instrumental in continuing to provide more efficient risk management in the global FX market. The synergy and robust affinities from joining the main CLSSettlement session via CLSClearedFX will enable us to better serve our clients.&rdquo;</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Premium Hikes Driven By Claims Costs, But Insurers Told To Improve Claims Handling</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="node-content__wrapper node-content__wrapper--border"><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has today revealed that while rising motor insurance premiums are largely driven by external cost pressures, shortcomings persist in how some insurers handle claims.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>FCA analysis shows that increases in the cost of motor claims &ndash; due to higher prices for cars, parts, labour, energy and more complex cars and supply chains &ndash; have contributed to premium increases. The cost of hire vehicles, the number and cost of theft claims and uninsured drivers have also risen significantly. This confirms that increased costs outside of firms&rsquo; control, rather than firm profit, were the biggest cause of recent premium rises in motor insurance.</p>
<p>However, the FCA did identify that referral fees from credit hire firms and claims management companies were associated with slower claims processing and increasing costs.</p>
<p>While it saw some good practice in the home and travel sector, it also uncovered concerning evidence of poor claims handling practices, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of oversight of outsourced services, resulting in poor customer outcomes, delays in settling claims and high complaint volumes;</li>
<li>Insufficient management information resulting in failures to promptly identify and resolve claims handling issues and delays;</li>
<li>High rejection rates for storm damage claims (only 32% of storm damage claims made to our sample of firms in 2024 resulted in a payment); and</li>
<li>Cash settlements being used without sufficient consideration of whether they are most suitable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Where it has seen poor practice from firms, the regulator is addressing it directly with them, including taking action against specific firms where necessary.</p>
<p>It is also providing the evidence needed for coordinated action from Government, industry, and other regulators, as part of the Government&rsquo;s motor taskforce, to help drive down the cost of motor premiums. This could help limit cost increases but it cannot prevent them.</p>
<p>Also published today was an interim update of the ongoing premium finance market study investigating whether consumers receive fair value when choosing to pay for insurance in monthly instalments. While premium finance allows customers to spread costs, making them affordable and providing flexibility, the regulator has found that some firms earn much more money than it costs to provide it. It will explore these concerns further in the next phase of the study and will seek to tackle any issues it finds first through the Consumer Duty, publishing a final report by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive of the FCA commented: 'Insurance provides peace of mind but people must be confident they can get a fair deal and be treated right when the worst happens.</p>
<p>'External cost pressures are primarily to blame for recent motor premium increases, not increased firm profits, but there is some more work to do on claims handling, particularly in home and travel. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re stepping up - making sure claims are handled promptly and fairly and pushing for a coordinated effort to tackle the root causes of rising motor premiums.</p>
<p>'A well-functioning insurance market helps consumers navigate their financial lives and supports growth by building people&rsquo;s resilience to financial and personal shocks.'</p>
<p>Given the importance of the insurance market to consumers, the FCA undertook a series of reviews to see how the market is working.</p>
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s evaluation of its pricing reforms showed they are having the intended impact on the price gap between new and existing customers in both the motor and home markets. This means its reforms were effective in curbing price-walking, where loyal customers &ndash; often vulnerable &ndash; were charged more at renewal.</p>

<li>Over the summer of 2024, the regulator reviewed the motor insurance market, looking for areas that could impact the functioning of the market or risks to consumer outcomes. This work coincided with the Government establishing a taskforce on motor insurance.</li>
<li>The FCA welcomed the taskforce in October 2024. At the same time, it publicly announced a number of priority areas where we were taking action, including several of the reports published today.</li>

<p><span>Gordian Capital is delighted to announce its plan for expansion into the Middle East, subject to approval from the Dubai Financial Services Authority (&ldquo;</span><span>DFSA</span><span>&rdquo;)</span><br /><br /><span>&ldquo;The Dubai International Financial Centre, (&ldquo;</span><span>DIFC</span><span>&rdquo;) has seen and continues to experience strong growth in the number of managers across alternatives and traditional strategies establishing an operation&rdquo; Mark Voumard Founder of the group and CEO of Gordian Capital Singapore Private Limited noted&rdquo;. He commented &ldquo;Going cross border can have its challenges, primarily in terms of speed to market, as well as meeting rigorous initial and ongoing operational and regulatory standards.&nbsp; This is where, provided we obtain regulatory approval, with the group&rsquo;s history of success and growth in Asia over the last 20 years, we plan to provide, a highly regulated market entry pathway and infrastructure for institutional quality GP&rsquo;s and managers seeking to establish a regulated presence in DIFC&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Gordian Capital is Asia&rsquo;s only fully licensed institutional fund platform operating in Singapore, Hong Kong and Tokyo, Asia&rsquo;s three key financial centers and is fully licensed and regulated with MAS (Singapore), SEC (USA), SFC (Hong Kong), FSA (Japan), NFA as a CTA (USA) and ASIC (Australia).

Their decision reflects the strength of DIFC as the region&rsquo;s leading financial hub with unparalleled depth in asset management, attracting new firms and business models that access the fast-growing markets of the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. We look forward to welcoming Gordian Capital to our ecosystem and supporting their expansion into the region.&rdquo;</span><br /><br /><span>Gordian Capital&rsquo;s clients include global institutional asset managers, Multi strategy/pod platforms, Family Offices, GPs, Hedge funds and Corporates across multiple strategies and structures across private equity, real estate, venture capital, infrastructure, hedge, absolute return and long only strategies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span>Established in 2004 by capital markets professionals and alternatives industry veterans active in Asia since the 1980s, Gordian Capital initially launched its first operating subsidiary in Singapore in 2005.

<p class="component-text">JPX Market Innovation &amp; Research, Inc. (JPXI) and Nikkei Inc. (Nikkei) launched a new index, the "JPX-Nikkei Index Human Capital 100".<br /><br />This index represents the performance of companies selected based on their efforts to incorporate human capital into their management practices. For the selection of constituent stocks, the human capital score, which factors in disclosure regarding the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and is calculated by ESG Book, a Germany-based ESG rating company, is primarily used. The comprehensive human capital score is calculated by adding extra points for factors considered important for companies, and the top 100 stocks from the JPX-Nikkei Index 400 are selected.<br /><br />We expect that widespread use of this index will lead to further human capital management within companies, and that investors will reap the benefits of increased corporate value, thereby promoting further initiatives related to human capital.</p>

<title>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent Remarks At The Federal Reserve Capital Conference</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good evening, it&rsquo;s an honor to be with you tonight.</p>
<p>Let me first express my appreciation to Vice Chair Bowman for arranging tomorrow&rsquo;s conference. The Vice Chair has certainly hit the ground running, and we are all impressed by her early results.</p>
<p>I share with her a strong view on the urgency of reform. And I especially agree with the high priority she has given as a governor on the Federal Reserve Board to issues affecting our community banks.</p>
<p>In past remarks, I have made clear that we need a fundamental reset of financial regulation. And the Treasury Department is committed to playing an active role in this effort. That&rsquo;s why earlier this year, I laid out guiding principles to build a financial system that delivers for both Wall Street and Main Street.</p>
<p>In the months since, we have begun delivering on that promise.</p>
<p>The bank regulators have proposed a recalibration of leverage capital requirements, ended the use of politicized reputation risk, proposed to rescind a byzantine 60,000-word Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) rule, launched work to focus supervision on material financial risks, started an interagency process on BSA/CFT reforms, and begun the effort to modernize our regulatory capital framework.</p>
<p>These first steps are chipping away at years of regulatory accretion. But isolated measures are not enough. We need deeper reforms rooted in a long-term blueprint for innovation, financial stability, and resilient growth.</p>
<p>Despite bank regulators&rsquo; significant influence on our economy, up until now, financial regulation has not been nested in a broader strategic vision for the financial system.</p>
<p>Instead, we have seen regulation by reflex. Rather than preempting crises, regulators all too often react to them after the fact. They play the role of a hazmat cleanup team instead of preventing dangerous spillovers in the first place. This is especially true in the case of supervisory failures, where regulators often overcompensate by piling rule on top of rule, based on an incomplete understanding of the larger costs and benefits to society. This reactionary approach can generate regulations at odds with our domestic and international priorities.</p>
<p>Some argue that in the past, regulatory weakening occurred when regulators failed to keep pace. And yet, the financial regulators have not, up to now, kept pace with digital assets or comprehended how their regulation by reflex was undermining the community bank model. Post-mortems to recent crises have been more self-serving exercises designed to support longstanding political agendas rather than honest, searching assessments about how to improve the system.</p>
<p>Rather than reflexively regulate anything that hits the headlines, we need to instead be more explicit about our vision for the financial system.</p>
<p>Defining that vision requires value judgments. And so, it cannot be a purely technocratic exercise. Instead, defining a path forward requires leadership with a broad perspective and coordination across the whole of government. The Treasury Department is perfectly positioned to provide that leadership.</p>
<p>Since Secretary Hamilton&rsquo;s Assumption Plan, Treasury has worked to articulate a coherent vision for our financial system. Since Secretary Chase, Treasury&rsquo;s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been responsible for our national banking system. And since our country&rsquo;s founding, Treasury has led emergency responses to every major financial crisis.</p>
<p>Treasury also has a broad remit to shape a vision for our financial system. Our domestic mandate includes fostering economic growth and stability. We represent America&rsquo;s economic interests abroad. And we strengthen national security by protecting the integrity of the financial system.</p>
<p>Consistent with that longstanding practice, I intend for Treasury to drive financial regulatory policy that puts American workers first, prioritizes growth, safeguards financial stability, and protects our national security.</p>
<p>To be clear, the bank regulators must continue to carry out their statutory mandates&mdash;maintaining safety and soundness, protecting consumers, and mitigating risks to financial stability. Rationalizing and tailoring regulation does not have to amount to regulatory weakening.</p>
<p>But in parallel, Treasury will convene interagency consultations to define a strategic policy direction.</p>
<p>To that end, Treasury will encourage bank regulators to consider how proposed rules will impact growth.</p>
<p>We will center financial regulation on Main Street, not Wall Street.</p>
<p>We will protect the viability of our community banks.</p>
<p>We will be vigilant against debanking of customers based on religious or political views on either side of the aisle.</p>
<p>We will reject international standard setting that does not advance America&rsquo;s interests.</p>
<p>We will support innovation both within and outside the financial system.</p>
<p>We will drive alignment between our illicit finance program and our national security priorities.</p>
<p>And we will ensure the big questions of the day are answered consistent with America&rsquo;s long-term interests. This includes the regulation of digital assets, the future of housing finance, and financial sector support for the onshoring of US manufacturing.</p>
<p>In all these efforts, Treasury&rsquo;s most important contribution might simply be to reinforce the urgency of reform. To that end, the department will break through policy inertia, settle turf battles, drive consensus, and motivate action to ensure no single regulator holds up reform.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the topic of tomorrow&rsquo;s conference.</p>
<p>We need to take a closer look at regulatory capital requirements.</p>
<p>Outdated capital requirements on some exposures are misaligned with actual risk, imposing unnecessary burdens on financial institutions. Excessive capitalization, for example, reduces bank lending. This stymies growth and distorts market structure in ways that increase risk. How? By driving lending out of the regulated banking system to nonbank intermediaries.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing a proposal that addresses this and other known deficiencies in our antiquated capital framework.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that the proposal will simplify and rationalize the framework. On that note, there is an incredibly consequential&mdash;albeit quite technical&mdash;structural issue that regulators should address early on.</p>
<p>Under the July 2023 proposal, a bank would have been subject to two sets of capital requirements&mdash;first, a modernized set, and second, a legacy set based largely on today&rsquo;s current &ldquo;standardized approach&rdquo;&mdash;with the greater of the two being the binding requirement.</p>
<p>This dual-requirement structure did not derive from a principled calibration methodology. It was motivated simply to reverse-engineer higher and higher capital aggregates. It also was at odds with capital reform as a modernization project because it would have preserved the antiquated capital requirements as the binding floor for many, perhaps most, large banks.</p>
<p>Bank regulators should consider abandoning this flawed dual-requirement structure.</p>
<p>Modernizing regulatory capital likely would mean reduced capital requirements for mortgage loans and some other exposures that are core to the community bank model. We cannot give only large banks the benefit of these reduced requirements, as actually contemplated by the last administration. One possible solution would be to give each bank that is not subject to the modernized requirements the choice to opt in. This would result in a meaningful reduction in capital for those banks.</p>
<p>I will close by reiterating my support for the Fed&rsquo;s open-mindedness on the need for regulatory modernization. I am grateful for economic policymakers at the Fed who understand the urgency of reorienting financial regulation and the critical need to preserve a central role for community banks.</p>
<p>It is promising to see so much interest in this important topic, and I look forward to continuing to work with you all on regulatory capital reform.</p>

<title>ASIC Probes Debt Management And Credit Repair Services</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-probes-debt-management-and-credit-repair-services-2025722/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-probes-debt-management-and-credit-repair-services-2025722/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC will launch a review into the debt management and credit repair sector, as part of its continued focus on protecting consumers, particularly those experiencing financial hardship.</p>
<p>ASIC Commissioner Alan Kirkland said: &lsquo;We are concerned some licensees may be failing to engage in credit activities efficiently, honestly and fairly, leaving financially vulnerable consumers worse-off as a result.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s surveillance will review how the sector, comprised of around 100 licensees, complies with the law. It will seek to understand the varying debt management and credit repair business models in operation.</p>
<p>ASIC will review instances where debt management firms may have failed consumers by not meeting the terms of their debt management agreement, charged high fees for no or limited services, or not communicated adequately with clients.</p>
<p>Commissioner Kirkland said: &lsquo;We have heard numerous accounts of debt management firms making promises to vulnerable consumers that may not have been kept.</p>
<p>&lsquo;In one instance, we heard that a woman could not get an answer on why her debt management firm was not making any payments to her creditors. After numerous calls to the firm, she was told to enter into bankruptcy with no further explanation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Another man was at risk of having his car repossessed after his debt management firm failed to respond to default notices from creditors. When he cancelled his contract and asked for a partial refund from the debt management firm, they said there was a no-refund policy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stories like these are disturbing and if we detect unfair and unlawful practices, we will take enforcement action to protect consumers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>ASIC intends to publish insights from the review in a public report in 2026.</p>
<p>The project aligns with ASIC&rsquo;s key enforcement priorities and aims to strengthen practices across the sector, while addressing the potential for consumer harm.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>A licensing regime was introduced in 2021 for debt management and credit repair firms to protect consumers from predatory practices.</p>
<p>Entities operating under this regime are required to hold a credit licence and comply with provisions of the&nbsp;<em>National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009,</em>&nbsp;as well as be a member of the Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA).</p>
<p>ASIC commenced proceedings in August 2023 in the Federal Court against Bakken Holdings Pty Ltd (Bakken), an operator of the debt management business Solve My Debt Now, following concerns of substantial consumer harm (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2023-releases/23-212mr-asic-sues-debt-management-firm-solve-my-debt-now-and-its-director/" title="23-212MR ASIC sues debt management firm Solve My Debt Now and its director">23-212MR</a>). In June 2025, ASIC refused Bakken&rsquo;s application for a credit licence, meaning Bakken cannot provide debt management services (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-101mr-asic-refuses-bakken-holdings-pty-ltd-s-australian-credit-licence-application-to-provide-debt-management-services/" title="25-101MR ASIC refuses Bakken Holdings Pty Ltd&rsquo;s Australian credit licence application to provide debt management services">25-101MR</a>).</p>
<p>ASIC also issued two infringement notices on debt management company Chapter Two Holdings Pty Ltd in April 2025 for alleged misleading statements made on its website regarding debt management outcomes. Chapter Two&rsquo;s website included statements that the company had wiped $80 million in debt and saved consumers $30 million in interest (<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-061mr-asic-fines-chapter-two-holdings-for-misrepresenting-debt-management-outcomes-offered-to-consumers/" title="25-061MR ASIC fines Chapter Two Holdings for misrepresenting debt management outcomes offered to consumers">25-061 MR</a>).</p>
<h2>For consumers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Any complaints about potential misconduct should first be made with your debt management firm and if it is not resolved can be taken up with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afca.org.au/make-a-complaint">AFCA</a>.</li>
<li>Consumers who are looking for debt help can find a range of free resources about&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/managing-debt">managing debt</a>&nbsp;on ASIC&rsquo;s Moneysmart website.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left"><span>Borrowers will find it easier to remortgage, saving time and money, under changes confirmed today by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>The package of measures is part of a series of reforms the regulator is undertaking to mortgage rules to help people navigate their financial lives and support growth by ensuring more people can benefit from choice in the mortgage market and the security of homeownership.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Under these changes, borrowers will:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span>Find it easier to reduce their mortgage term, helping to lower the total cost of borrowing and reduce the risk of repayment extending into retirement.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>More easily remortgage with a new lender, helping them access cheaper products.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><span>Be able to discuss options with their mortgage provider and get advice when they need it.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p align="left"><span>The FCA expects many borrowers to continue to benefit from regulated mortgage advice. Lenders are expected to consider what is appropriate to identify consumers who need advice or other support.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Emad Aladhal, director of retail banking at the Financial Conduct Authority, said:</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We are helping more people navigate their financial lives by supporting those who can afford to buy a home and supporting competition in the mortgage market.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>&ldquo;Consumer needs have changed over recent years, and our rules are changing too.</span><span>&nbsp;Today&rsquo;s changes support growth by simplifying some of our rules, saving consumers time and money, while ensuring they still benefit from advice, where needed.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>&ldquo;We want lenders to use these changes to innovate and better serve aspiring homeowners and existing borrowers. These reforms are another significant step in our mortgage rule review, which we&rsquo;re delivering quickly. They are supported by the strong protections we&rsquo;ve already put in place for consumers in the mortgage market&rdquo;.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>As part of the changes, the FCA is also removing guidance that has served its purpose to reduce the regulatory burden.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Reform of the mortgage market is possible because of the high standards set by the FCA. These include effective affordability checks, support for those who get into financial difficulty and the Consumer Duty, which requires lenders to achieve good outcomes for borrowers.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>Changes to the mortgage rules&nbsp;</span><span>were included in the FCA&rsquo;s letter to the Prime Minister earlier this year, linking with the goals in its strategy to help consumers and support growth.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /><span>While these changes are voluntary for firms, supporting sustainable home ownership and a competitive mortgage market is a collective responsibility. The FCA is playing its part and is encouraging firms to use these flexibilities to help broaden access, strengthen competition and support greater innovation and choice for consumers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On July 17 and 18, promotional events for the 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;China International Fair for Investment and Trade (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.v-2BJ3gj6ki5QD5j-2Fn6dQLivCtzQ03MDbWm9F9JNtc0wZcJzF4AtMCS30MzM0bLhwpcTSfjGK9cTtpyI0yXMt2Kw-3D-3DMjxy_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJQO3t1CT4hkrJ2TKk8NjNoi4oBjPVgrjKTSbRWjXhs3Y3qZF1tSFbKEz2SJczaDMa0tZIDiOHa-2FNS8DfgyRqu5dym8yqeoHdfacMqxM1GP1D0qoIPliJA7-2FmrYTV78inbRT79FD2r-2FQC4r4RjzQk-2BO3h31qoIn4Gl31NkkKTtldned3iHycn-2F-2B-2BaRDHHP-2F563H7-2FEAvWbP2vKFzAqDJ-2FV-2Bjo42ZUOujOio9vTpoo0gfmLYL-2FYownEmMbTF0VFmFg-2BNXTItoJzdALTontF7QSnp2X1z60eQwQceyKbBOj67Kg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CIFIT</a>) were held in Hong Kong and Macao, respectively. The events drew more than 400 representatives from government agencies, chambers of commerce, financial institutions, and the private sector.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg457eleft"><img align="middle" alt=" " id="prnejpg457eleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2735022/image.jpg" title=" " /></div>
<p><b>Partnering with Strategic Connectors to Strengthen Global Industry Linkages</b></p>
<p>Through sustained engagement with stakeholders in Hong Kong and Macao,&nbsp;CIFIT continues to advance broader international economic integration. These efforts include facilitating outbound investment by businesses based in mainland China and providing&nbsp;professional support to assist international investors seeking to enter the Chinese market. The roles of Hong Kong and Macao as strategic nodes in global investment corridors remain central to this agenda.</p>
<p><b>Collaborating with Super Value Creators to Strengthen Financial Integration</b></p>
<p>As a long-standing&nbsp;CIFIT participant, Hong Kong continues to exhibit at the fair and upholds its role as one of the world's most open economies, global hub for financial services, trade, shipping, and innovation. Macao continues to build on its strengths in cultural tourism, convention and exhibition services, financial innovation, and traditional Chinese medicine. The region draws on the Guangdong&ndash;Macao In-Depth Cooperation Zone&nbsp;in Hengqin to support engagement with Lusophone markets through CIFIT-related initiatives.</p>
<p><b>Creating New Channels for Global Business Engagement<br /></b></p>
<p>The Fair will take place in&nbsp;Xiamen from September 8 to 11, 2025. The United Kingdom will serve as the Guest Country of Honor, while Jiangsu Province will be recognized as the Guest Province of Honor. Under the theme&nbsp;<b><i>Expanding Two-Way Investment, Advancing Global Development</i></b>, the Fair will focus on three priority areas:&nbsp;<b><i>Invest in China</i></b>,&nbsp;<b><i>Outbound Chinese Investment</i></b>, and&nbsp;<b><i>International Investment</i></b>, with an emphasis on strengthened global engagement and thematic specialization.</p>
<p>Participants noted the fair's role as a key platform for facilitating engagement between Hong Kong and Macao businesses and their mainland counterparts, supporting outbound commercial activity, and enhancing inbound foreign investment. The integration of Hong Kong and Macao's international networks and service platforms further amplifies the fair's ability to align global resources with strategic development goals.</p>
<p>As the host city prepares for the 25<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;CIFIT, Xiamen extends an open invitation to international stakeholders to serve as long-term partners.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dechert LLP announced today that Joseph Dennis has joined the firm as a partner in London in its corporate and securities practice group to bolster the firm's global M&amp;A and private equity capabilities.</p>
<p>With over 15 years of experience, Mr. Dennis advises both domestic and international private equity funds, as well as financial investors, portfolio companies and management teams. His expertise spans a diverse range of transaction types including UK and international leveraged buyouts, growth capital investments, reorganisations, disposals and management incentive schemes. Mr. Dennis has strong experience in key industry sectors including financial services, asset and wealth management, real estate, infrastructure, technology, media and telecommunications and fintech.</p>
<p>Widely recognised as a leading practitioner in the private equity space,&nbsp;<i>Chambers UK 2024</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Legal 500 2025</i>&nbsp;describe Mr. Dennis as "excellent" and commend his "strong work ethic and exceptional negotiation skills". Furthermore, Mr. Dennis is noted by clients for his "very strong levels of client service, sophistication and commercial vision". He has been distinguished in&nbsp;<i>Legal Week's 40 under 40: The Rising Stars in Private Equity</i>&nbsp;in 2019 and then, again, in 2023.</p>
<p>Co-chair of Dechert, Mark Thierfelder, said: "Joseph's addition demonstrates our clear strategic focus on growing and further strengthening our global private equity practice specifically, and broader asset manager-facing practice more generally, and strongly aligns with our growth strategy focused on attracting top-tier talent and expanding our presence in the key markets and money centres around the world."</p>
<p>Ken Young, co-chair of Dechert's corporate and securities practice added: "We are thrilled to welcome Joseph to Dechert. Joseph brings with him a wealth of experience and a proven track record of success in advising on a broad range of private equity and broader private capital transactions. His deep understanding of the private equity landscape and strong client relationships will be hugely valuable as we continue to expand our capabilities and deliver exceptional service to our clients."</p>
<p>Mr. Dennis said: "I am excited to be joining Dechert's very well-established and impressive global private equity practice, with its deep industry expertise and innovative approach. The firm's commitment to excellence and its strategic presence in key financial centres worldwide provide an excellent opportunity to drive growth for our clients in an increasingly complex market."</p>
<p>Mr Dennis' appointment closely follows the hires of Nick Tomlinson in February 2025 and Anthony Lombardi in October 2024, further strengthening the firm's private equity, corporate M&amp;A and fund finance capabilities in London.</p>
<p>Dechert has been at the forefront of advising private equity firms for more than 40 years. In recent years, the practice has been ranked among the top law firms for U.S. and Global PE Buyouts and Global M&amp;A by Bloomberg, LSEG, and Mergermarket. With 350 private capital and private equity clients, the firm has unique insights into how the industry has evolved and where it's going next. Dechert's globally integrated team of more than 500 lawyers advises private equity, private credit and multi-strategy asset managers on flexible solutions at every phase.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In order to ensure efficient regulation that appropriately balances costs and benefits, the U.S. Department of the Treasury&rsquo;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) today is announcing its intention to postpone the effective date of the final rule establishing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/09/04/2024-19260/financial-crimes-enforcement-network-anti-money-launderingcountering-the-financing-of-terrorism">Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Program and Suspicious Activity Report Filing Requirements for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers</a>&nbsp;(IA AML Rule) and to revisit the scope of the IA AML Rule at a future date.&nbsp; FinCEN anticipates delaying the effective date of the IA AML Rule from January 1, 2026, until January 1, 2028.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IA AML Rule seeks to address ongoing illicit finance risks, threats, and vulnerabilities posed by criminals and foreign adversaries that exploit the U.S. financial system and assets through investment advisers.&nbsp; FinCEN recognizes, however, that the rule must be effectively tailored to the diverse business models and risk profiles of the investment adviser sector. FinCEN also recognizes that extending the effective date of the rule may help ease potential compliance costs for industry and reduce regulatory uncertainty while FinCEN undertakes a broader review of the IA AML Rule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While FinCEN will work through the rulemaking process to extend the effective date, FinCEN intends to provide the IA sector with regulatory certainty by issuing appropriate exemptive relief delaying the effective date.&nbsp; During the delayed effective date, FinCEN intends to revisit the substance of the IA AML Rule through a future rulemaking process and, together with the Securities and Exchange Commission, also intends to revisit the joint proposed rule establishing customer identification program rule requirements for investment advisers,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/21/2024-10738/customer-identification-programs-for-registered-investment-advisers-and-exempt-reporting-advisers">Customer Identification Programs for Registered Investment Advisers and Exempt Reporting Advisers</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), a leading global provider of technology and data, today announced it is working with NatureAlpha, a provider of AI-driven nature and biodiversity risk analytics, to integrate NatureAlpha&rsquo;s nature-related metrics into the ICE Climate Analytics Platform, which provides physical and transition climate risk metrics and analytics for fixed income and equity assets globally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biodiversity loss is a consideration when analyzing climate and financial stability, and with the addition of NatureAlpha data, we are providing clients with the tools to help them manage climate and nature-related financial risks, supporting everything from trading strategies to reporting and regulatory compliance,&rdquo; said Larry Lawrence, Head of ICE Climate. &ldquo;Our collaboration with NatureAlpha allows us to deliver the depth, granularity, and biodiversity insights needed to meet these growing expectations and support more informed investment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>NatureAlpha&rsquo;s platform, Geoverse 2.0, now accessible through the ICE Climate Analytics platform, provides granular biodiversity and nature risk insights across 8.5 million global asset locations. Through this integration, ICE Climate has mapped these metrics to its comprehensive universe of fixed income and equity instruments&mdash;including 1.7 million corporate bonds and 11,500 global equities.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s Climate Analytics Platform supports institutional investors with portfolio management, advanced multi-asset class dashboards, and real-time hazard monitoring.

<p>By working with NatureAlpha, ICE Climate is now able to unify spatial intelligence and nature exposure analytics within a single platform. This integration also supports alignment with emerging global frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), helping clients meet growing expectations for transparency.</p>

<title>Nasdaq Verafin Announces Launch Of Its Agentic AI Workforce, Delivering A Step Change In AML Compliance Efficiency - Suite Of Digital Workers Will Automate Resource-Intensive Workflows, Empowering Banks To More Effectively Fight Financial Crime</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-verafin-announces-launch-of-its-agentic-ai-workforce-delivering-a-step-c-2025721/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/nasdaq-verafin-announces-launch-of-its-agentic-ai-workforce-delivering-a-step-c-2025721/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left">Nasdaq&nbsp;Verafin&nbsp;today announced the launch of the Agentic AI Workforce, a suite of digital workers that will deliver a step change in the way banks conduct anti-money laundering (AML) compliance by automating low-value, high-volume compliance processes. Building on the successful adoption of its GenAI Entity Research Copilot, Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s Agentic AI Workforce is made up of digital workers that can be deployed by banks to execute complex tasks, including decisioning, with minimal supervision.</p>
<p>According to Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=8vC8ltDYzdHXXZX8tuLw8Hdrfj-lWCS4olA7_57R9ji1yHK5_VfGqhgAzIY9v_pbi_Nn1rPRXkrdC1TQ3nQ1DRnVNkyyhiMt5PImgxu3CtDnZyqphPZ6U84WoOamaNn-Jf6EWoloLy_9AuFPyHMORQ==" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Global Financial Crime Report</a>, a survey of more than 200 industry professionals found that 75% of respondents had increased their investment in headcount over the prior year to improve financial crime prevention efforts. However, despite increased investment in headcount, nearly half of respondents reported a lack of adequate resources and technology to fight financial crime. With the ability to independently analyze, document, and decision end-to-end processes, the digital workers enable banks to reallocate resources to more sophisticated investigations and outcomes-focused activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s operating environment, banks are tasked with navigating a growing number of compliance challenges from evolving regulatory requirements to the shortcomings of legacy technology and impact of resource constraints on compliance teams," said&nbsp;<span>
Rob Norris, SVP and Head of Product, Nasdaq Verafin</span>. &ldquo;Our Agentic AI Workforce will transform the way banks of all sizes approach AML compliance, delivering a step change in efficiency gains that allows compliance teams to shift efforts and focus on the important work of tackling serious financial crimes such as human trafficking, drug trafficking, and other facets of organized crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first of the digital workers will focus on two of the most resource-intensive areas of compliance &ndash; Sanctions Screening and Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) reviews. Currently in beta, the first digital workers are expected to be available to Nasdaq Verafin clients later this year.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Digital Sanctions Analyst&nbsp;</span>will aid Sanctions Screening by dispositioning, documenting, and actioning false positive alerts, while escalating true matches for further review by bank investigators. Sanctions compliance is a complex and costly problem for financial institutions, with compliance failures leading to civil penalties and reputational damage. Further, legacy approaches to Sanctions Screening can hamper compliance teams with an overwhelming number of false positive alerts. Initial results show that Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s Digital Sanctions Analyst reduces a bank&rsquo;s alert review workload by more than 80%.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Digital EDD Analyst&nbsp;</span>will automate a bank&rsquo;s periodic EDD review process, actioning low-risk cases that do not require further investigation, offering significant efficiency gains for banks. Meeting regulatory requirements for conducting EDD reviews of high-risk customers is a growing challenge for financial institutions, as reviews at most institutions rely on time-consuming manual processes. The Digital EDD Analyst will allow financial institutions to streamline their risk review process, delivering a step change in efficiency and significantly reducing operational expenses.</p>
<p>The launch of the Agentic AI Workforce represents the latest evolution of Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s industry-leading financial crime management solutions, following the successful rollout of the&nbsp;GenAI Entity Research&nbsp;copilot. Since releasing the Entity Research Copilot into Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s case management module in the second quarter of 2025, clients have leveraged this feature in tens of thousands of cases to help streamline and expedite investigations and documentation. In all, more than 1,300 clients have benefited from Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s integrated GenAI copilot capabilities across its platform since launch.</p>
<p>"The financial services industry is grappling with mounting pressure to enhance operational efficiency while maintaining robust compliance operations amid increasingly sophisticated threats,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<span>
Chuck Subrt, the Fraud &amp; AML Practice Director at Datos Insights</span>. &ldquo;We are witnessing a transformative shift as institutions seek to automate resource-intensive workflows that traditionally consume the vast majority of analysts' time on data collection and processing. Digital workforce solutions like Nasdaq Verafin&rsquo;s Agentic AI Workforce flip the investigator time equation to enable human experts to focus on high-value decision-making and critical analysis."</p>

<title>Bank Of England And UK Financial Conduct Authority – Memorandum Of Understanding On The Supervision Of Financial Market Infrastructure - Joint Statement From The Bank Of England And Financial Conduct Authority</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-and-uk-financial-conduct-authority-memorandum-of-understanding-2025721/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/bank-of-england-and-uk-financial-conduct-authority-memorandum-of-understanding-2025721/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The framework for cooperation is set out in a memorandum of understanding (MoU)<sup>1</sup>. This MoU facilitates effective supervision and policy making by exchanging information between the regulators and promotes efficiency by minimising duplication of regulatory activities regarding FMIs. Signatories must review the MoU annually<span><sup>2</sup></span>&nbsp;to confirm whether the intended arrangements are proving effective. This involves requesting feedback from supervised firms on whether the proposed cooperation is working effectively as part of the review process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA wrote to FMIs: Central Counterparties (CCPs), Recognised Investment Exchanges (RIEs) and Recognised Central Securities Depositories (RCSDs); to review their cooperation, based on these firms&rsquo; interaction in 2024. Respondents welcomed the opportunity to provide feedback and reported a high degree of coordination across both policy and supervisory matters. Respondents remain fully supportive of the MoU and recognise the importance of effective planning and coordination between the Bank and the FCA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Respondents specifically noted the benefits of a coordinated approach to work on operational resilience, including parallel consultations on &lsquo;Operational Incident and Third-Party Reporting&rsquo;, noting the value in clearer reporting expectations, and consistent frameworks for reporting. The authorities will continue to adopt a coordinated approach as we progress towards publication of a final policy statement in H2 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Bank and FCA agree that the arrangements of the MoU regarding co-operation continue to be effective with appropriate coordination and no material duplication. This is evidenced by the successful collaboration across several workstreams over the past 12 months, including the Digital Securities Sandbox (DSS) and T+1 settlement. The authorities remain aware that through efficient coordination, we can improve the effectiveness by which we supervise firms. The Bank and FCA will seek to address any specific areas identified by firms.</p>
<p>The FMI MoU was updated in 2024 to reflect changes made by the Financial Services Markets Act (2023).<br /><br /></p>

<title>Securities Commission Malaysia: MyCIF Surpasses RM1 Billion Co-Investment Mark, Driving MSME Growth In Malaysia</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-mycif-surpasses-rm1-billion-co-investment-mark-2025721/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/securities-commission-malaysia-mycif-surpasses-rm1-billion-co-investment-mark-2025721/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Malaysia Co-Investment Fund (MyCIF) has exceeded RM1 billion in total coinvestments since its inception, a major a milestone in supporting the growth of micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in the country.</p>
<p>MyCIF, set up by the Ministry of Finance under Budget 2019, has been a pivotal force in the financing landscape, utilising equity crowdfunding (ECF) and peer-to-peer (P2P) financing platforms to channel funds into MSMEs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its inception, more than 9,500 MSMEs have benefited from MyCIF&rsquo;s coinvestments.</p>
<p>In its Annual Performance Report 2024 released today, MyCIF said total coinvestments reached RM1.19 billion as of end-2024, with RM264 million invested in 2024 alone.</p>
<p>MyCIF has attracted 4.1 times in private sector funding for every ringgit invested, demonstrating a strong crowding-in effect. This saw a 21.4% increase in total private investment.</p>
<p>The RM1.19 billion total co-investments by MyCIF represents 4.6 times of RM260 million total funds disbursed from the Government to date into the program, demonstrating efficient use of public funds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the General Scheme 1:4 co-investment, MyCIF continues to bolster strategic and underserved segments of the economy through targeted schemes. These include Food Security and Environmental &amp; Social Enterprise Schemes with preferential 1:2 co-investment ratio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Co-investments in these segments rose to RM7 million in 2024 from RM3.4 million in 2023, reflecting MyCIF&rsquo;s strengthened commitment to targeted investment areas.</p>
<p>Under Budget 2025, MyCIF has earmarked up to RM40 million for promoting innovative Islamic risk-sharing financing through ECF and P2P platforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This allocation complements existing MyCIF schemes and aims to encourage greater adoption of Islamic financing structures (Musharakah and Mudharabah concepts) by offering the following incentives:</p>
<ul>
<li>MyCIF will invest on a first-loss basis in ECF and P2P campaigns based on Islamic risk-sharing models; and &nbsp;</li>
<li>For P2P campaigns, MyCIF will additionally invest at 0% financing rate.</li>
</ul>
<p>In July 2024, MyCIF introduced the Environmental &amp; Social Impact Scheme to support impact-driven businesses in environment, community, food security, education, and healthcare sectors. The scheme also extends to MSMEs financing Waqf asset development projects within these focus areas.</p>
<p>To enhance awareness and access to financing, MyCIF hosted its inaugural Nationwide</p>
<p>Roadshow in Penang in February 2025, themed &ldquo;Empowering Financing, Advancing</p>
<p>Growth.&rdquo; The event, supported by the Northern Corridor Implementation Authority (NCIA), aimed to raise MyCIF&rsquo;s profile and benefits among MSMEs in the northern states of Malaysia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The MyCIF will next hold a roadshow in Kota Kinabalu on 31 July 2025 to help raise awareness of alternative funding avenues and build the connectivity between the capital market and entrepreneurs in Sabah to further support MSME growth.</p>
<p>The MyCIF Annual Report and other details are available <a href="https://www.sc.com.my/mycif">here</a><a href="https://www.sc.com.my/mycif">.</a></p>

<div class="_mas-typeset contain m-t:l m-b:3xl mas-rte-content">
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced today the appointment of the first batch of asset managers under the S$5 billion&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/development/asset-management/equity-market-development-programme" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">Equity Market Development Programme</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;(EQDP). MAS and the Financial Sector Development Fund (FSDF) will place an initial amount of S$1.1 billion for management with these appointed managers. MAS has also committed S$50 million to strengthen support for local equity research and to grow a more vibrant listed product ecosystem. In addition, MAS outlined proposals to enhance investors&rsquo; ability to seek recourse.<br /><br />2.&nbsp;<span> </span>These initiatives build upon the&nbsp;<a class="mas-link" href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/a-comprehensive-set-of-measures-to-strengthen-singapores-equities-market" target="_blank"><span class="mas-link__text">first set of measures</span>&nbsp;<span class="mas-icon mas-glyphs-external--link">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;announced by the Equities Market Review Group in February 2025. The set of measures<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#1">[1]</a></span>&nbsp;aims to increase investor interest, improve our ecosystem&rsquo;s attractiveness to quality listings, and adopt a more pro-enterprise regulatory stance while strengthening investor confidence. MAS has since consulted on proposals to streamline prospectus requirements and broaden investor outreach channels for initial public offerings. Today&rsquo;s announcement provides an update on the ongoing review by the MAS and the Review Group to strengthen the functioning of Singapore&rsquo;s equities market. The Review Group aims to complete its work and release its final report by end-2025.<br /><br /><span>MAS sets aside S$1.1 billion from EQDP for the first batch of three appointed asset managers</span><br /><br />3.&nbsp;<span> </span>Since the announcement of the EQDP in February, MAS has received strong interest from the asset management industry in the programme, with indications of interest from over 100 global, regional and local asset managers. MAS is reviewing the submissions in batches to speed up the asset manager appointment and capital deployment process.<br /><br />4.&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS has appointed the first three asset managers under the EQDP, and will place a combined initial sum of S$1.1 billion with them, out of the total S$5 billion that has been set aside for EQDP. The asset managers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Avanda Investment Management</li>
<li>Fullerton Fund Management</li>
<li>JP Morgan Asset Management</li>
</ul>
<p>5.&nbsp;<span> </span>A range of factors was taken into account in selecting the managers, including the alignment of their proposed fund strategies with the EQDP objectives, the strength of their proposals to crowd in third-party capital into their strategies alongside MAS&rsquo; funding<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#2">[2]</a></span>, and their commitments to expand or contribute to the growth of the asset management and research capabilities in Singapore. In particular, the fund strategies should have a clear focus on improving liquidity and broadening participation in Singapore equities, with significant allocation to small- and mid-cap stocks.<br /><br />6.&nbsp;<span> </span>MAS is reviewing the remaining submissions and will appoint additional asset managers to manage the remaining funds under the S$5 billion EQDP<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#3">[3]</a></span>. The next phase of selection is expected to be announced by 4Q 2025. By investing with a broad range of fund managers employing varied strategies, the EQDP can leverage their distinct investment expertise and distribution networks to attract commercial capital and strengthen market vibrancy. This will help to improve price discovery and trading liquidity in Singapore&rsquo;s equities market.<br /><br /><span>MAS commits S$50 million until end-2028 to strengthen equity research and listing support</span><br /><br />7.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group has recommended a shift towards a more disclosure-based regime in its first set of measures. In tandem with this shift, it is important to enhance the quality of equity research as a complementary measure. This facilitates price discovery and fair valuation of companies, and enables investors to make informed and timely decisions. Industry feedback has indicated that research coverage, particularly in the small- and mid-cap segment, could be improved. More efforts can also be made to engage younger investors through digital media channels, and to expand upstream research coverage of pre-IPO companies to support potential IPOs.<br /><br />8.&nbsp;<span> </span>To complement the Review Group&rsquo;s overall efforts to enhance the vibrancy of our markets and broaden investor participation, MAS will set aside S$50 million from the FSDF to enhance the Grant for Equity Market Singapore (GEMS) Scheme. This will strengthen the equity research ecosystem, and complement the supply side initiatives to grow the listed product suite in Singapore. The GEMS Scheme will also be extended till 31 December 2028<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#4">[4]</a></span>.</p>
<p>a) The&nbsp;<span>Research Development Grant</span>&nbsp;under GEMS will be enhanced to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional funding of S$1,000 for each research report, with a further S$1,000 if the report is an initiation of research coverage<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#5">[5]</a></span>&nbsp;or covers pre-IPO stage and newly-listed companies. This brings the maximum funding from S$4,000 (current) to S$6,000 (enhanced) per research report<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#6">[6]</a></span>. This enhanced funding aims to boost investor awareness and trading interest in under-researched segments, particularly small- and mid-cap enterprises.<br /><br /></li>
<li>New grant funding for research houses to defray costs of research dissemination via digital media. The expanded grant support aims to broaden investor outreach and engagement, especially among younger investors who consume information via digital channels.<br /><br /></li>
<li>New funding to support research on private companies with strong local presence, to foster investor familiarity and build a pipeline of potential listings. Applicants seeking funding for research on private companies may submit proposals to MAS for consideration.</li>
</ul>
<p>b) The&nbsp;<span>Listing Grant</span>&nbsp;under GEMS will also be expanded to enhance product diversity and trading liquidity in Singapore. This will comprise:</p>
<ul>
<li>A new funding sleeve to cover Singapore Depository Receipts (SDRs) and foreign Depository Receipts (DR) with underlying Singapore stocks, providing S$40,000 per DR issuance. This aims to increase overall trading interest and liquidity in Singapore, while broadening the global investor base for Singapore equities.<br /><br /></li>
<li>Increasing the overall funding per primary listed ETF, from S$100,000 to S$250,000. A new funding sleeve will also support cross-listed and feeder ETFs at S$180,000 per listing. This will facilitate more ETF listings in Singapore, adding to the range of listed investment products to provide more investor choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>The enhancements to the GEMS Scheme will complement the other initiatives, including the EQDP, to raise investor interest and trading liquidity, and position Singapore to support more quality listings. Interested applicants may refer to the MAS website for more information.<br /><br /><span>Measures to strengthen investor protection through enhancing investor recourse avenues</span><br /><br />9.&nbsp;<span> </span>In shifting towards a more disclosure-based regime, there is also a need to consider additional measures to strengthen investor protection through enhancing investor recourse avenues. Specifically, investors should be able to seek civil recourse should there be losses suffered due to market misconduct. Currently, there have been feedback and observations that retail investors seem to face friction in commencing civil action &ndash; such as difficulty in self-organising, and finding sufficient funds for legal advice.<br /><br />10.&nbsp;<span> </span>Facilitating investors to seek civil recourse is therefore important to bolstering investor confidence, maintaining market integrity and upholding the reputation of Singapore&rsquo;s capital markets. In doing so, there is also a need to address concerns of frivolous legal actions that would unduly burden the market, by putting in place appropriate safeguards. In line with the Review Group&rsquo;s guidance, MAS has identified three areas of focus and will consult on proposals later this year:</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;<span>Enabling pursuit of legal action</span>&nbsp;&ndash; MAS will consult on proposals to enhance existing legal provisions that enable investors to ride on a court action or civil penalty to seek compensation. This is intended to reduce the burden on investors when pursuing civil recourse action.<br /><br />b)&nbsp;<span>Facilitating self-organisation</span>&nbsp;&ndash; MAS will consult on proposals to allow for representatives to organise and carry out legal action on behalf of investors. This is intended to facilitate not-for-profit assistance to investors, including by organisations such as the Securities Investors Association Singapore (SIAS). MAS will consult on the criteria for such representatives, to reduce the risk of potential profiteering behaviour and vexatious litigation.<br /><br />c)&nbsp;<span>Providing access to funding</span>&nbsp;&ndash; MAS will consult on setting up a grant scheme to defray the costs of organising investors and taking legal action for cases involving market misconduct. This aims to reduce cost barriers that deter investors from seeking compensation through civil action.<br /><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>More measures and progress to be announced later this year</span><br /><br />11.&nbsp;<span> </span>The Review Group continues to review other initiatives to enhance Singapore&rsquo;s equities market. These include measures to uplift companies&rsquo; shareholder engagement capabilities, strengthen the value proposition and attractiveness of Catalist board, enhance market-making mechanisms to promote deeper liquidity and price discovery, reduce board lot sizes to facilitate wider retail investor access, enhance efficiency of post-trade custody arrangements, and develop cross-border partnerships.<br /><br />12.&nbsp;<span> </span>To complement the Review Group&rsquo;s work, the Corporate Governance Advisory Committee has also begun a review<span><a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2025/mas-appoints-first-batch-of-eqdp-asset-managers#7">[7]</a></span>&nbsp;of the Code of Corporate Governance to continue upholding high standards of corporate governance.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent issued the following statement following President Trump&rsquo;s signing of the GENIUS Act:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stablecoins represent a revolution in digital finance,&rdquo; said Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. &ldquo;The dollar now has an internet-native payment rail that is fast, frictionless, and free of middlemen. This groundbreaking technology will buttress the dollar&rsquo;s status as the global reserve currency, expand access to the dollar economy for billions across the globe, and lead to a surge in demand for US Treasuries, which back stablecoins. The GENIUS Act provides the fast-growing stablecoin market with the regulatory clarity it needs to grow into a multitrillion-dollar industry. The signing of this bill marks a seminal moment for digital assets and dollar supremacy.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The signing of the GENIUS Act into law marks an important milestone in the effort to bring regulatory clarity to crypto&mdash;a necessary prerequisite for innovation in our markets to flourish and for the American public to benefit from that innovation. The new law confirms that payment stablecoins are not securities. People have voted with their dollars&mdash;privately issued stablecoins already enjoy broad use as a payments mechanism. The GENIUS Act, by putting a regulatory framework around them, aims to protect current and future users and the financial system. The GENIUS Act charges state and federal banking regulators with overseeing payment stablecoin issuers. This clear direction from Congress also should serve as a catalyst for the SEC to provide guidance on how SEC registrants can use&mdash;and accommodate their customers&rsquo; use of&mdash;payment stablecoins. I invite investors and market participants regulated by the SEC to engage with the Crypto Task Force on what the Commission needs to do, in light of the GENIUS Act, to ensure that SEC registrants interacting with payment stablecoins can serve their customers effectively, efficiently, and safely.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-genius-act-071825?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>President Trump&rsquo;s signing the GENIUS Act is a monumental step forward for crypto assets, financial markets, and our country. As I have stated previously, blockchain and crypto asset technologies have the potential to revolutionize America&rsquo;s financial infrastructure and deliver new efficiencies, cost reductions, transparency, and risk mitigation for the benefit of all Americans. Ensuring that the U.S. is the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business requires clear rules of the road that allow market participants to adopt emerging technologies with confidence. President Trump and the entire Administration are sending a powerful message that America is ready to embrace crypto asset innovation.</p>
<p>The GENIUS Act provides necessary guidance for a crucial element of the emerging crypto asset ecosystem. Clear payment stablecoin regulation allows companies and individuals to transact in ways that boost efficiency and lower costs. Payment stablecoins will play a significant role in the securities industry moving forward, which is why I have asked SEC staff to consider whether guidance, rulemaking, or other steps may be helpful to accommodate SEC registrants utilizing payment stablecoins, including for settlement and margining. I invite market participants to engage with the SEC staff on what is needed for our securities markets to take advantage of the GENIUS Act&rsquo;s full potential.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s developments are a major milestone in achieving President Trump&rsquo;s goal of making America the &ldquo;crypto capital of the world.&rdquo; The Trump Administration and Congress have thus far made terrific progress, and there is more work to do. The SEC will work diligently to consider any changes needed to achieve regulatory clarity. Together we will make America the center of crypto asset innovation and strengthen the financial markets for the benefit of all Americans.</p>

<title>CFTC Commissioner Johnson Hosted The Regulators’ Roundtable: Financial Markets Innovation And Supervision Of Emergent Technology In London</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/cftc-commissioner-johnson-hosted-the-regulators-roundtable-financial-markets-i-2025718/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>On July 14, 2025, Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Kristin Johnson convened the third annual international financial markets regulation roundtable in London. The agenda and engagement focused on rapidly evolving technologies &mdash; with emphasis on the increasing integration of artificial intelligence, the proliferation of cyber threats, and the rapid adoption of digital assets across global financial markets.<a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/9096-25?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p>During the Emergent Technologies Roundtable, Commissioner Johnson explained &ldquo;AI holds significant promise for making financial services more inclusive, efficient, and accessible. But its deployment must be underpinned by robust governance, ethical design, and global regulatory collaboration. For global regulatory leadership &hellip; the challenge is to balance innovation with stability, openness with security and privacy protections, and the benefits of automation with the value of human oversight.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the need for effective governance, Commissioner Johnson explained that &ldquo;governance &mdash; at the firm level and the system level &mdash; matters more than ever. Fintechs must invest in model risk management, ethical design, and responsible data practices. Supervisory approaches must evolve to keep pace with the changes occurring in the markets subject to our supervision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Roundtable also explored issues of operational resilience in the face of mounting cyber attacks launched by sophisticated actors operating from dark corners in many jurisdictions around the world with the potential to severely disrupt local and global financial markets. &ldquo;Cyber resilience is a critical gateway issue for protecting market integrity, and an area where we need to be &lsquo;all hands on deck&rsquo; on both sides of the pond. Cyber resilience is only as strong as its weakest link. It is important to stay vigilant and collaborate closely on best practices and lessons learned,&rdquo; Commissioner Johnson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Commissioner Johnson, &ldquo;convening regulators offers an exceptional opportunity for colleagues to share learning and understanding on emerging and persistent issues that directly impact market integrity, stability, and security. It has been my pleasure to coordinate an annual conversation among regulators each year of my service as a Commissioner.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roundtable attendees included&nbsp;representatives of the&nbsp;Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the&nbsp;Bank of England,&nbsp;the Financial Conduct Authority,&nbsp;<span>Banco de Espa&ntilde;a&nbsp;(the central bank of Spain)</span>,&nbsp;the European Securities and Markets Authority,&nbsp; Deutsche Bundesbank (the central bank of the Federal Republic of Germany), the&nbsp;Comisi&oacute;n National del Mercado de Valores (the Spanish Securities Market Commission),the City of London, the Financial Action Task Force, the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, and the London School of Economics Law School, among others.</p>
<p>The attendees discussed a number of issues, including regulatory responses to cyber threats and operational resilience for systemically important financial institutions and market participants; risk management concerns and effective oversight of non-financial institution third party service providers; the impact of increasing reliance on AI; and strategies to enhance integrity, stability, and accountability in global financial markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I extend my gratitude to the roundtable attendees,&rdquo; Commissioner Johnson continued. &ldquo;Hopefully, the insightful dialogue inspires harmonization, coordination, and collaboration across financial banking and market regulation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p align="left">Today, Nasdaq issued the following statement on the preliminary proxy filed by&nbsp;Invesco QQQ Trust&nbsp;and the proposals contained within it.</p>
<p>Nasdaq is aware of the preliminary proxy that was filed by&nbsp;Invesco QQQ Trust&nbsp;and the proposals contained within it. Invesco and Nasdaq were engaged in dialogue as Invesco explored bringing these proposals to shareholders.</p>
<p>The proposed change to the Trust structure does not alter the terms of Nasdaq&rsquo;s licensing arrangements with Invesco nor the administration of the Nasdaq-100<span>&reg;</span>&nbsp;Index. If the proposals are approved, Invesco will pay the associated license fee out of its unitary management fee, as compared to the current state where the license fee is paid by QQQ directly.</p>
<p>We remain committed to our strategic partnership with Invesco and delivering the trusted benchmark on which investors rely.</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-names-mascha-canio-head-of-private-debt-2025718/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The California Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement System today announced that Mascha Canio has been named managing investment director for its private debt portfolio.</p>
<p>Canio has decades of experience managing a variety of asset types on behalf of pension systems. She joins CalPERS after nine years as head of credit and insurance-linked investments at Dutch pension fund service provider PGGM, where she has managed assets valued at approximately $17 billion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mascha will bring a wealth of talent and experience to her new role,&rdquo; said Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s spent a career working to improve returns for pension funds, and managed portfolios across different asset classes. These experiences and her keen understanding of credit markets will allow us to build on the success of our private debt program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Earlier this week, CalPERS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/newsroom/calpers-news/2025/calpers-announces-preliminary-116-return-for-2024-25-fiscal-year">announced&nbsp;</a>that private debt earned a 12.8% return for the 2024-25 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In other senior positions at PGGM, always in combination with credit risk sharing, Canio was responsible for infrastructure, private equity, and insurance-linked investments. Her financial expertise was also tapped to shore up financially troubled segments of the Netherland&rsquo;s economy during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Before PGGM, Canio served as head of Europe at Octagon Credit Investors, a U.S.-based corporate credit investment advising firm. She set up the firm&rsquo;s European office after it decided to expand into Europe, and managed investments in the European market for leveraged bank loans and high-yield bonds.</p>
<p>Her career began in 1991 at Shell Pension Fund in the Netherlands where she quickly rose through the ranks to become a senior member of the fixed income team. In her role as a fund manager, Canio actively managed a portfolio in government debt, corporate bonds, and emerging markets debt.</p>
<p>Canio earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in business administration from Nyenrode Business University in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Her appointment will take effect this October.</p>
<p>The private debt program has been under the interim direction of Anton Orlich, head of private equity, for the past year. Please visit the CalPERS Investment Office&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/investments/about-investment-office/">website&nbsp;</a>for an overview of the program.</p>

<p>Moving to the crypto area, ESMA identified opportunities to strengthen MiCA authorisation.

<p>Moreover, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-news/esma-promotes-clarity-sustainability-related-communications">thematic notes</a>&nbsp;outline four guiding principles on making sustainability claims used in non-regulatory communications.

<div class="container">
<p>Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) borrowers will benefit from key protections in place for other types of lending, under proposals put forward by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The proposals include requiring lenders to check that people can afford to repay BNPL loans and to offer support if they get into financial difficulty. They form part of the FCA's commitment to helping consumers navigate their financial lives. BNPL borrowers will also be able to complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service if something goes wrong. The rules would take effect when BNPL comes under the FCA's remit in 2026.</p>
<p>Sarah Pritchard, deputy chief executive at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We have long called for BNPL products to be brought into our remit, so people can benefit from BNPL while being protected. Our regulation will help consumers navigate their financial lives, with checks on whether they can afford to repay, support when things go wrong and access to the right information to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re mainly relying on existing requirements, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>, rather than proposing to make lots of new rules, supporting growth and allowing firms to innovate.'</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/fls-2024-credit-loans.pdf" title="fls-2024-credit-loans.pdf">FCA's research (PDF)</a>&nbsp;on unregulated BNPL found 1-in-5 (20%) UK adults (10.9 million) had used it at least once in the 12 months to May 2024, up from 17% (8.8 million) in 2022.</p>
<p>BNPL can provide benefits for consumers by giving them access to affordable credit and offers a convenient way to spread payment for goods and services. But, as with other credit products, there are also risks and potential for harm.</p>
<p>There will be a temporary permissions regime in place. This means firms will need to follow FCA rules and will be able to continue to trade before they&rsquo;re fully authorised. The FCA welcomes views from BNPL lenders, consumer groups, the wider industry and other interested parties on its proposals to help shape the final rules. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/consultation-papers/cp25-23-deferred-payment-credit-proposed-approach-regulation" title="CP25/23: Deferred Payment Credit (unregulated Buy Now Pay Later): proposed approach to regulation ">consultation is open for feedback until 26 September 2025</a>.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>BNPL is a broad term which can include credit agreements that are already regulated. The proposals set out today relate to unregulated BNPL agreements, which is referred to as deferred payment credit (DPC) in the Consultation Paper.</li>
<li>The temporary permissions regime will be open for firms to register 2 months before the regime comes into force on 15 July 2026. Firms will then have 6 months (from the date the regime comes into force) to apply for full authorisation.</li>
<li>The Government has made legislation to bring DPC products into FCA regulation. DPC (often referred to as BNPL) refers to unregulated interest-free credit that finances the purchase of goods or services and that is repayable in 12 or fewer instalments within 12 months or less.</li>
<li>The FCA has published an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/occasional-papers/op69-impact-bnpl-credit-consumer-indebtedness-arrears" title="Occasional Paper 69: Distress deferred? The impact of Buy Now Pay Later credit on consumer indebtedness and arrears ">Occasional Paper</a>&nbsp;which finds that DPC users are, on average, younger, less creditworthy, have higher levels of unsecured debt, and more likely to be in financial difficulty compared to the UK population. They are also almost twice as likely to be in serious financial distress than the rest of the UK population. However, we do not find consistent evidence that DPC borrowing causes medium-term indebtedness.</li>
<li>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-work" title="How we work">FCA's strategy</a>&nbsp;sets out 4 priorities for the next 5 years, which include supporting growth and helping consumers navigate their financial lives.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/financial-lives/fls-2024-credit-loans.pdf" title="fls-2024-credit-loans.pdf">Financial Lives survey data (PDF)</a>&nbsp;on unregulated BNPL shows: 
<ul>
<li>Most unregulated BNPL users used it relatively infrequently, but frequency of use is increasing. For example, in the 12 months to May 2024, 1.9 million adults (17% of all users) used BNPL frequently (10 or more times in this period), up from 1.2 million (14% of all users) in 2022. In May 2024, 2% of UK adults (1.1 million) had &pound;500 or more outstanding unregulated BNPL debt, and 11% of UK adults (5.3 million) had &pound;50 or more outstanding &ndash; 86% had no outstanding debt.</li>
<li>The highest rates of unregulated BNPL use included adults aged 25-34 (30% had used it at least once in the 12 months to May 2024), adults with low resilience (30%), and adults living in the most deprived areas of the UK (29%). The most common use for it in the 12 months to May 2024 was for lifestyle and beauty purchases (41%), followed by &lsquo;treating myself or other people&rsquo; (37%). 8% of those who used it in the last 12 months said they used it to cover &lsquo;everyday essential expenses&rsquo;.</li>
</ul>

<title>ACER Reports On Gas Developments And On Energy Retail Markets - LNG Surge And Storage Recovery Improve Europe’s Short-Term Gas Outlook</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Published today,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsPV1cAWFhRV0xaAA0HHVYBVwYdUw0HUBpRAQZUBQMGAwADVAYdA1MABV8HAlEdUQ4HBB0GAQUHGlddAAMZAgQOVFVQCQJZBldSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER&rsquo;s latest report on key developments in European gas wholesale markets (Q2 2025)</a>&nbsp;examines key trends in prices, supply and storage during the early months of the gas summer season. The analysis supports policy discussions on enhancing secure and competitively priced gas in Europe.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What trends did ACER monitoring find?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gas wholesale prices and volatility:</strong>&nbsp;Average wholesale gas prices fell by over 20% compared to Q1 2025, following a high-price winter. Price volatility eased, but remained relatively high, while regional price differences widened.</li>
<li><strong>LNG imports:</strong>&nbsp;Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports rose by more than a third year-on-year, supported by competitive hub prices, slack demand in Asia and expanded US liquefaction capacity.</li>
<li><strong>Pipeline imports:</strong>&nbsp;No major changes were observed, except for Russian supply to the EU, which dropped by 45% year-on-year following the expiry of transit contracts via Ukraine. Deliveries now reach the EU only through the TurkStream pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Gas storage:</strong>&nbsp;Gas injections increased by 75 TWh year-on-year, helping to reduce the gap in storage levels compared to previous years. This follows a relatively tight end-of-winter, when stocks were lower than in 2023 and 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Looking ahead</span></p>
<p>If current LNG inflows and storage injection levels continue, Europe is likely to enter winter with healthy reserves. Still, risks remain: extreme weather, disruptions to major supply sources&nbsp;or geopolitical instability could alter the trajectory. On the supply side, the expected expansion of global LNG production in late 2025 and 2026 may help ease pressure.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsBUwcBWAUFVkwBBlVUHVYMAlcdCg1XUBpXVgYEAANUB1cHB1cdA1MABV8HAlEdUQ4HBB0GAQUHGlddAAMZAgQOVFVQCQJZBldSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more.</a><br /><br />***</p>
<p><strong>ACER monitoring reveals limited competition and untapped flexibility in EU retail energy markets&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>ACER has today published its 2025 retail energy country sheets for all 27 EU Member States and Norway. For the first time, both&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsHBVMDVFAGAUxbAgNUHVYOAw8dCl0CXxpQXVcGAAJXAA9SA1UdA1MABV8HAlEdUQ4HBB0GAQUHGlddAAMZAgQOVFVQCQJZBldSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">electricity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAAMBAlEHUUwODwAAHVYJUQUdUwoGVhoNAwYCUFdRVQVTBAgdA1MABV8HAlEdUQ4HBB0GAQUHGlddAAMZAgQOVFVQCQJZBldSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">gas</a>&nbsp;are covered. The country sheets complement ACER&rsquo;s retail Monitoring Report (coming in November).</p>
<p>ACER has also updated its&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtQAgZXBwRdVExcBVUAHVZaAAMdC1tVVxpWUlUOA1IGVQ9QVQIdA1MABV8HAlEdUQ4HBB0GAQUHGlddAAMZAgQOVFVQCQJZBldSRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">retail pricing dashboard</a>, tracking monthly household energy prices across EU Member States and Norway from January 2019 to June 2025.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is happening in retail markets?</span></p>
<p>Electricity market:</p>
<ul>
<li>Smart meter rollout is uneven, with 80% deployment in half of the EU, but still below 20% in 7 Member States.</li>
<li>Despite an increased number of hours with low wholesale electricity prices (below &euro;5/MWh) in 2024, 15 Member States still rely heavily on fixed or regulated contracts. This limits consumers&rsquo; exposure to real-time price signals and leaves demand-side flexibility untapped.</li>
<li>In 21 Member States, prosumers account for between 1% and 10% of households, while Belgium (22%) and the Netherlands (30%) are in the lead.</li>
<li>Electricity retail prices across Europe stabilised by June 2025, ending the decline observed since early spring. On an annual basis, EU household electricity prices rose by approximately 3%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gas market:</p>
<ul>
<li>82% of household gas is used for space and water heating, stressing the role of energy efficiency and building renovation.</li>
<li>A decline in gas demand has been recorded in 21 Member States since 2022, while biomethane production remains relatively low.</li>
<li>Gas retail prices remained largely stable, with minor monthly changes. Retail offers rose by 7% compared to the same period last year.</li>
</ul>

<title>Euroclear Reports Robust H1 2025 Results</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Results for the first half year ended 30 June 2025</p>
<p><b>Financial highlights</b></p>
<p>Solid business performance and improved operating margin despite challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic environment</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><i>Underlying</i><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;business income for H1 2025 reached &euro;932 million, an 8% increase compared to H1 2024. Higher safekeeping revenues, supported by an increase in group depot and in settlement and communication income, reflect a robust equity market recovery and strong issuance activity.</li>
<li>Following the acquisition of a 49% stake in Inversis, Inversis' results are consolidated as from March 1<sup>st</sup>, contributing for &euro;4.7 million to Euroclear's share of results in H1 2025.</li>
<li>In line with expectations, underlying interest and banking income continues to decrease (-6%) to &euro;551 million, mainly impacted by lower interest rates. This was partly offset by an increase in average deposits.</li>
<li>Operating costs increased by 3% to &euro;682 million when adjusted for non-recurring items<sup>2</sup>. Cost mitigation measures initiated last year continue to progress and partially compensate the inflation and higher compensation spend.&nbsp;</li>
<li>As result of the positive operating leverage, business income operating margin improved to 27.2% (approx. +4% percentage points), reflecting continued growth in core activities and effective cost control.</li>
<li>Resulting adjusted net profit remains stable year-on-year at &euro;598 million. Adjusted Earnings Per Share is &euro;190<sup>3</sup>.</li>
<li>Q2 2025 business income remained consistent with the very strong performance in Q1, which was marked by volatility due to US announcements and geopolitical uncertainties. Volatility slightly decreased in the second quarter while issuances remained strong. As a result of the ongoing cost control measures, Q2 expenses remained in line with previous quarter.</li>
<li>Euroclear Group's capital position remains very strong, comfortably above regulatory requirements with a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of around 61%<sup>4</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The impacts of the Russian sanctions are detailed in the last section of this press release.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Valerie&nbsp;Urbain, Chief Executive Officer of Euroclear, commented:</b></p>
<p><i>"We are reporting robust results for the first half of 2025, in line with our expectations. Our business income continues to increase (+8%) to &euro;932 million, reflecting our strong operational performance in settlement and safekeeping activities, and making our results less reliant on interest income. I am also pleased to see initiatives such as our strategic partnership with Inversis in Spain start to contribute to the company's profit.</i></p>
<p><i>As Europe's largest player in post-trade, Euroclear has been actively contributing to the financing of the European economy and integration of European markets for decades, notably through the Eurobond and iETF models. As we move forward, we are accelerating our strategy to answer the clear needs outlined in Europe's Savings and Investments Union (SIU). Our ambition is to further facilitate the seamless flow of capital across Europe by building on the know-how, synergies, scale and global connectivity of our model which combines our international CSD (Euroclear Bank) with our six domestic CSDs in Europe and the UK. This unique, open model positions Euroclear as Europe's gateway to the world.</i></p>
<p><i>In the same spirit, the recent announcement of our AI powered tool EasyFocus+ is part of our commitment to make our clients' life easier and to support industry transitions such as widescale T+1 settlement by optimising market connectivity and boosting settlement efficiency. As a business of scale, Euroclear is accelerating its use of AI to automate increasingly sophisticated processes and enhance its customer service. Euroclear's open access model gives clients a choice of interconnected international and national CSDs, supporting competition, avoiding costly silos - ultimately delivering a single, seamless interface."</i></p>
<p><b>Business performance</b></p>
<p>The key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate an excellent business performance during the period.</p>

<p>Euroclear continued its strong performance, with assets under custody reaching record levels, marking an eleventh consecutive quarter of growth. Turnover rose 18% from H1 2024, driven by robust fixed income and settlement activity amid volatile markets and geopolitical uncertainty. Collateral Highway outstanding and fund depots remain near peak levels.</p>
<p><b>Q2 2025 business milestones</b></p>
<p><i>Savings &amp; Investments Union</i></p>
<p>Euroclear recently unveiled a comprehensive plan to establish a true single market for post-trade services in all 27 Member States across all asset classes. This initiative, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of European market infrastructure, will support the Savings and Investments Union's (SIU) ambitions and ensure Europe remains the 'go-to place' for investors and issuers globally.</p>
<p>Euroclear's ambitious project builds on the know-how, scale and global connectivity of its unique model: combining the leading international Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Bank) with its local CSDs in Europe. This open-model positions Euroclear as Europe's gateway to the world - enabling it to connect global markets, drive innovation and unlock further efficiency.</p>
<p><i>Contributing to stability and liquidity in the Eurosystem</i></p>
<p>At the end of Q2, Euroclear successfully connected to the European Central Bank's Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS), marking a major step forward in the harmonisation of the management of collateral used in the Eurosystem. The recently launched ECMS replaces 20 separate National Central Bank (NCB) access points with a single, unified platform.</p>
<p>This connection strengthens Euroclear's central position in asset custody and liquidity management, supported by our Collateral Highway, the world's first neutral and global open architecture for institutions looking to optimise their collateral strategies.</p>
<p><i>Supporting the transition to T+1 with AI enabled data-driven insights</i></p>
<p>In support of the industry's transition to T+1 settlement in Europe by October 2027, Euroclear has announced the next generation of its&nbsp;EasyFocus&nbsp;service in partnership with Meritsoft and&nbsp;Taskize. EasyFocus+ provides clients with an enhanced, AI-powered platform, running on a Microsoft cloud, to deliver real-time data, insights and resolution capabilities across all of Euroclear's Central Securities Depositories (CSDs). The move aligns with Euroclear's strategy of reducing industry fragmentation, advancing the EU's Savings and Investments Union (SIU) and delivering services that optimise market connectivity.</p>
<p><i>End-to-end solution for investment funds in Asia Pacific</i></p>
<p>Euroclear and&nbsp;Marketnode, the Singapore based digital market infrastructure operator, have announced the roll out of a comprehensive, end-to-end fund order and processing solution for retail and institutional investors in Singapore. The service streamlines multiple activities across the retail cash and pension fund order and settlement lifecycle, allowing client to reduce manual intervention, improve reconciliation processes and accelerate settlement times.

<ul type="disc">
<li><i>Interest&nbsp;</i>earnings from Russian sanctioned assets were &euro;2.7 billion, a 21% decrease from H1 2024 due to gradual rate cuts. Future interest earnings will continue to evolve in line with future policy rates.</li>
<li>As required by the EU windfall contribution regulation, Euroclear provisioned &euro;1.8 billion as windfall contribution for H1 2025, of which &euro;1.6 billion will be paid to the European Commission in July 2025.</li>
<li><i>The Russian sanctions and countermeasures resulted in direct costs of &euro;52 million and a loss of business income of &euro;16 million.</i></li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasures</b></p>
<p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key obligation. Therefore, well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.</p>
<p>As a result of the sanctions, blocked coupon payments and&nbsp;redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of June 2025, Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled &euro;229 billion, of which &euro;194 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.</p>
<p>In line with&nbsp;Euroclear's risk appetite and policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation, Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first half of 2025, interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately &euro;2.7 billion.</p>
<p>Euroclear continues to act prudently and&nbsp;to strengthen its capital by retaining&nbsp;the remainder of the Russian sanction related profits&nbsp;as a buffer against current and future risks. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal, financial, and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients, while complying with its obligations.</p>
<p>As a direct consequence of the sanctions and countermeasures, Euroclear faces multiple proceedings in Russian courts. Since Russia considers international sanctions against public order, Russian claimants initiated legal proceedings aiming mainly to access assets blocked in Euroclear Bank's books, by claiming an equivalent amount in Russian Ruble and enforcing their claim in Russia. Despite all legal actions taken by Euroclear and the considerable resources mobilised, the probability of unfavourable rulings in Russian courts is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions.</p>

<title>Treasury International Capital Data For May</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The U.S. Department of the Treasury today released Treasury International Capital (TIC) data for May 2025.&nbsp; The next release, which will report on data for June 2025, is scheduled for August 15, 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sum total in May of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term U.S. securities, and banking flows was a net TIC inflow of $311.1 billion. &nbsp;Of this, net foreign private inflows were $333.2 billion, while net foreign official outflows were $22.1 billion.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term U.S. securities in May; their net purchases were $318.5 billion.&nbsp; Net purchases by private foreign investors were $287.5 billion, and net purchases by foreign official institutions were $31.1 billion.</p>
<p>U.S. residents increased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net purchases of $59.1 billion.</p>
<p>After including adjustments, such as estimated foreign portfolio acquisitions of U.S. stocks through stock swaps, overall net foreign sales of long-term securities are estimated to have been $259.4 billion in May.</p>
<p>Foreign residents increased their holdings of U.S. Treasury bills by $0.5 billion.&nbsp; Foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term U.S. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $10.3 billion.</p>
<p>Banks&rsquo; own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased&nbsp;by $41.4 billion.</p>
<p><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/data/treasury-international-capital-tic-system">Complete data are available on the Treasury website here</a>.</p>
<p class="text-align-center">###</p>
<p>About TIC Data</p>
<p>The monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on Major Foreign Holders of Treasury Securities, reflect foreign holdings of U.S. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.&nbsp; These data help provide a window into foreign ownership of U.S. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of U.S. securities with complete accuracy.&nbsp; For example, if a U.S. Treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.&nbsp; The custodial data will also not properly attribute U.S. Treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.&nbsp; In addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other U.S. assets that are not captured in the TIC data.&nbsp; For these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from TIC data about changes in the foreign holdings of U.S. financial assets by individual countries.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, John, and thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.</p>
<p>My purpose this evening is to explain why I believe that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should reduce our policy rate by 25 basis points at our next meeting.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I used to tell my junior research colleagues that presentations are not murder mysteries&mdash;just tell the audience up front "who did it" by telling them the main point. So let me follow my own advice and state up front the reasons I believe we should cut the policy rate at our meeting in two weeks.</p>
<p>First, tariffs are one-off increases in the price level and do not cause inflation beyond a temporary surge. Standard central banking practice is to "look through" such price-level effects as long as inflation expectations are anchored, which they are.</p>
<p>Second, a host of data argues that monetary policy should be close to neutral, not restrictive. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth was likely around 1 percent in the first half of this year and is expected to remain soft for the rest of 2025, much lower than the median of FOMC participants' estimates of longer-run GDP growth. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate is 4.1 percent, near the Committee's longer-run estimate, and headline inflation is close to our target at just slightly above 2 percent if we put aside tariff effects that I believe will be temporary. Taken together, the data imply the policy rate should be around neutral, which the median of FOMC participants estimates is 3 percent, and not where we are&mdash;1.25 to 1.50 percentage points above 3 percent.</p>
<p>My final reason to favor a cut now is that while the labor market looks fine on the surface, once we account for expected data revisions, private-sector payroll growth is near stall speed, and other data suggest that the downside risks to the labor market have increased. With inflation near target and the upside risks to inflation limited, we should not wait until the labor market deteriorates before we cut the policy rate.</p>
<p>Let me explain my reasoning by starting with my view of economic activity. Given the ups and downs of monthly indicators of GDP this year, we can best get a view of the performance of the economy by combining the first- and second-quarter numbers. With the data in hand, estimates suggest that real GDP increased at an annual rate of about 1 percent in the first half of this year, compared with 2.8 percent in the second half of 2024. That comparison is important not only for the extent of the slowdown, which is considerable, but also because it is well below most estimates of the potential growth rate of the economy. Based on forward-looking indicators, I don't expect a rebound in the second half&mdash;in fact, most forecasts suggest that real GDP growth will remain around 1 percent at an annual rate. While the recent tax bill has a significant number of elements that will spur economic growth in the future, not much of those effects will show up this year.</p>
<p>The slowdown in GDP is evident in consumer spending, which constitutes about two-thirds of economic activity. After hovering near 3 percent last year, real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) growth is estimated to have stepped down to 1 percent in the first half of this year. This morning the Commerce Department announced June retail sales. The data are consistent with this forecast, as the increase is on the heels of a couple of soft monthly readings. As we move forward this year, consumer spending is expected to continue to grow at a similar pace, tempered by the expected slowing in growth of real disposable income because of the temporary effects of tariff increases. I will say more about tariffs when I discuss inflation, but in assessing the near-term momentum of the economy, tariffs could well be a factor.</p>
<p>Turning to the "soft" data, this picture of declining momentum is consistent with what I am hearing from my business contacts and other sources. The Fed's July 16th Beige Book reported mixed evidence on economic activity across Federal Reserve Districts, with 5 reporting slight or modest gains and the remaining 7 having flat or declining activity.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;This mixed news is also found in surveys of purchasing managers where there is a continuing contraction in manufacturing and a slight expansion in nonmanufacturing activity. Given that firms outside manufacturing represent the large majority of businesses, this implies a modest expansion in activity.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the labor market. The headline numbers from the June jobs report looked reassuring&mdash;the unemployment rate stands at 4.1 percent, within the range it has been for the past year, and payroll gains were reported as 147,000, essentially the same as in May. But looking a little deeper, I see reasons to be concerned. Half of the payroll gain came from state and local government, a sector of employment that is notoriously difficult to seasonally adjust this time of year. In contrast, private payroll employment grew just 74,000, a much smaller gain than in the previous two months, and that is consistent with other surveys you might have read about that found a drop in private-sector employment.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;I focus on private-sector employment not only because it is the lion's share of employment, but also because it is a better guide to the cyclical movement in employment than counting public and private sector together. As I used to tell my students, the Federal Reserve's job should be to maximize private-sector employment, not government employment.</p>
<p>And there is another reason to cite the slowdown in private-sector hiring. A pattern in data revisions in recent years tells us that the private payroll data are being overestimated and will be revised down significantly when the benchmark revision occurs in early 2026. Accounting for the anticipated revision to the level of employment in March 2025 and extrapolating forward, private-sector employment gains last month were much closer to zero.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;This is why I say private-sector payroll gains are near stall speed and flashing red.</p>
<p>This is only one month of data, I realize, and one possible factor in the slowdown in private-sector hiring could be a deceleration in net immigration this year, although it will take time to get a clear picture of how immigration is affecting employment. But other data support the idea of a slowdown in hiring. There are widespread media reports of the difficulty new college graduates are encountering in finding jobs, and, in fact, the unemployment rate for new grads is at a 10-year high, far above the level before the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p>Looking across the soft and hard data, I get a picture of a labor market on the edge. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey reports continued low rates of firing but also low rates of hiring. I suspect this is a hangover of a labor market that was very tight after the pandemic, leaving employers resistant to let go of qualified workers for fear of renewed labor shortages. That said, purchasing managers report caution and even some pauses on hiring. The June 4th Beige Book reported declining labor demand in every single Federal Reserve District, and the July 16th Beige Book emphasized that labor demand continued to be less than labor supply in many industries. With hiring already low, at a certain point, declining demand would overcome any instinct to hold on to workers, and if that attitude does shift, it implies that a larger and more sudden reduction in payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate are a risk.</p>
<p>To sum up here, I see the hard and soft data on economic activity and the labor market as consistent: The economy is still growing, but its momentum has slowed significantly, and the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate have increased.</p>
<p>Let's turn to the inflation data. In the past two days, we received June consumer and producer price data that give us a good idea of the inflation rate based on PCE, the FOMC's benchmark for monetary policy. After several months of readings that moved the 12-month inflation rate closer to the FOMC's target, the consumer price index and the producer price index suggest that total PCE inflation moved up to around 2.5 percent in June, and core inflation likewise rose to roughly 2.7 percent. I believe these data reflect some modest effect from tariff increases, which began in February, and I believe there are further tariff-induced increases to inflation to come later this year, with the asterisk that there remains a lot of uncertainty about how trade agreements or escalations in trade conflicts may affect that outcome.</p>
<p>To understand how tariffs are affecting prices, I have been following not only the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly data, but also studies of high frequency price data. For example, some researchers this year are tracking the short-run price impact of tariffs on goods prices in real time by examining product-level price data from online stores of large U.S. retailers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Using data through mid-July, they find that, on net, imported goods prices have increased modestly while domestic goods prices are little changed. Looking across country of origin, Chinese goods imports have seen the most persistent and steady price increases. That said, to date, the data point to very small goods price increases relative to the size of the tariff rates.</p>
<p>This finding is consistent with my view that a large share of tariff increases won't be passed through to consumers. My presumption has been that consumers will have to pay about one-third of the price increases from higher tariffs, with the remainder split between foreign suppliers and U.S. importers. So if there is a permanent increase to import tariffs of about 10 percent, I expect this will raise PCE inflation three-tenths of 1 percent this year, and that this increase would fade over the next year or so.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>I can think of a couple of other reasons that may limit the impact on consumers. The first is that the slowing down of the rollout of many tariffs, with multiple postponements for continuing negotiations, may be giving U.S. importers time to substitute finished or intermediate goods to domestic suppliers or foreign sources subject to lower tariffs. A second reason is that, faced with the slowing economy that I have described and the likelihood that tariffs will be weighing on consumer spending, foreign producers and importers may be finding ways to hold the line on prices to maintain their presence on store shelves and hold on to customers. In fact, slowing demand increases competition for all firms, and consumers may benefit. Finally, despite all of the discussion of supply chain disruptions, tariff effects on supply chains are completely different than what happened during the pandemic. In the pandemic, supply chains were actually broken: Many workers were not working, factories were idle, and waves of COVID were hitting at asynchronous times across the globe. In contrast, in the case of the higher tariffs, we know exactly where things are being produced, and nothing is broken&mdash;firms are simply arguing about prices and who will eat the tariffs. Once that gets resolved, goods will flow naturally across the globe but potentially using different routes.</p>
<p>It is possible, of course, that tariffs may have a larger effect on inflation than I expect, but that won't affect my view of the implications for monetary policy. As I have said many times, tariff increases are a one-time boost to prices that do not sustainably increase inflation. In the absence of an unanchoring of inflation expectations and an acceleration of wage growth, which we have not seen, tariffs won't and can't permanently increase the inflation rate. What does this mean for monetary policy? Research shows that central bankers should&mdash;and, in fact, do&mdash;look through price-level shocks to avoid needlessly tightening policy in times like these and damaging the economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>The key question for monetary policy right now is what we can discern about the underlying rate of inflation&mdash;that is, the rate excluding tariffs&mdash;based on the fundamentals of the economy. Federal Reserve Board staff has done work to try to estimate tariff effects on PCE prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Using that methodology, if I subtract estimated tariff effects from the reported inflation data, I find the inflation numbers for the past few months would have been quite close to our 2 percent goal. You're not going to hear "mission accomplished" from me, but what this tells me is that underlying inflation has been lower than what is reported and close to our objective.</p>
<p>Besides tariffs, I don't expect an undesirable, sustained increase in inflation from other forces. Among the reasons for this are that the rate of growth in labor compensation is down considerably in the past year or two, and, with the softening labor market, I do not expect workers will be able to get large wage increases going forward. Combining this with solid rates of productivity growth implies inflation should continue around 2 percent.</p>
<p>Two more points support my inflation outlook, and I will only summarize them here since I discussed them at length in my June outlook speech.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;The first addresses the question of whether I could be making the same kind of mistake my FOMC colleagues and I made in 2021 and 2022 in expecting inflation increases to be only transitory when they turned out to be persistent. But unlike then, there is no pandemic disrupting labor, goods, and services supply around the world, and economic growth is now slow and slowing, rather than expanding rapidly. These differences bring me to the second point, which is that unlike in 2021 and 2022, when expectations of future inflation rose, today the measures of expectations I watch remain firmly anchored.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250717a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a></p>
<p>To sum up, tariffs have boosted, and will continue to boost, inflation a bit above the FOMC's 2 percent objective this year, but policy should look through tariff effects and focus on underlying inflation, which seems to be close to the FOMC's 2 percent goal, and I do not see any concern for forces driving it persistently higher.</p>
<p>As I hope will be evident by now, the evidence of a slowing economy, and all the factors I have cited weighing on economic activity, mean that the risks to the FOMC's employment mandate are greater, and sufficient to warrant an adjustment in the stance of monetary policy. Based on June's Summary of Economic Projections, the current target range for the federal funds rate of 4-1/4 to 4-1/2 percent is 125 to 150 basis points above the participants' median estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate of 3 percent. While I sometimes hear the view that policy is only modestly restrictive, this is not my definition of "modestly."</p>
<p>In fact, the distance that must be traveled to reach a neutral policy setting weighs heavily on my judgment that the time has come to resume moving in that direction. In June, a majority of FOMC participants believed it would be appropriate to reduce our policy rate at least two times in 2025, and there are four meetings left. I also believe&mdash;and I hope the case I have made is convincing&mdash;that the risks to the economy are weighted toward cutting sooner rather than later. If the slowing of economic and employment growth were to accelerate and warrant moving toward a more neutral setting more quickly, then waiting until September or even later in the year would risk us falling behind the curve of appropriate policy. However, if we cut our target range in July and subsequent employment and inflation data point toward fewer cuts, we would have the option of holding policy steady for one or more meetings.</p>
<p>For this reason, I believe it makes sense to cut the FOMC's policy rate by 25 basis points two weeks from now. And looking to later this year, if, as I expect, underlying inflation remains in check&mdash;with headline inflation data reporting modest, temporary increases from tariffs that are not unanchoring inflation expectations&mdash;and the economy continues to grow slowly, I would support further 25 basis point cuts to move monetary policy toward neutral.</p>

<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The employment services firm ADP reported that private sector employment declined by 33,000 in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. My estimate of the anticipated revision is based on the difference between the currently published level of payroll employment and the count of employment from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is used to benchmark the payroll employment figures. The QCEW data, which are currently available through 2024:Q4, suggest that the monthly change in payroll employment has been overstated by roughly 60,000 per month since March 2024.&nbsp;</p>

Waller (2025), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250601a.htm">The Effects of Tariffs on the Three I's: Inflation, Inflation Persistence, and Inflation Expectations</a>," speech delivered at "Structural Shifts and Monetary Policy," 2025 Bank of Korea International Conference, Bank of Korea, Seoul, South Korea, June 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn8"></a>8. Edward Nelson documents central banks' views of various price shocks. As long as inflation expectations are anchored, both nominal wage growth and inflation in the post-shock period should be able to continue at pre-shock rates, as neither has been upset by a rise in inflation expectations, and output and employment can also grow along paths that are undisturbed by the shock. See Edward Nelson (2025), "<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/a-look-back-at-look-through.htm">A Look Back at 'Look Through,'</a>&nbsp;" Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2025-037 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. See Waller, "The Effects of Tariffs on the Three I's," in note 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. I consider survey-based measures of inflation expectations unreliable, and the market-based measures that I watch have remained firmly anchored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blockchain and crypto asset technologies have the potential to revolutionize America&rsquo;s financial infrastructure and deliver new efficiencies, cost reductions, transparency, and risk mitigation for the benefit of all Americans. Innovators experimenting with these exciting technologies deserve clear rules of the road, which the GENIUS Act provides for payment stablecoins. Over the coming months and years, I look forward to watching the market leverage the regulatory framework provided by the GENIUS Act to go to market with payment stablecoins solutions that make transactions quicker, cheaper, and safer&mdash;all while maintaining robust risk safeguards.</p>
<p>Financial innovation is critical for making the U.S. the best and most secure place in the world to invest and do business. This is an important step to spur innovation by providing the crypto industry with clear rules of the road. Today&rsquo;s passage of the GENIUS Act sends a powerful message that this Administration is charting a new course. I look forward to continuing to work to make America&mdash;already the world&rsquo;s leader in financial market innovation&mdash;the center of crypto asset innovation as well.</p>

<title>EBA Publishes Handbook On Simulation Exercises For Resolution Authorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-handbook-on-simulation-exercises-for-resolution-authorities-2025717/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-handbook-on-simulation-exercises-for-resolution-authorities-2025717/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the latest chapter of its resolution Handbook on simulation exercises for resolution authorities. The Handbook provides, for the first time, a comprehensive framework of best practices, methodologies and processes to support resolution authorities in enhancing their preparedness and operational capabilities through structured simulation exercises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>​Testing requirements are already imposed to institutions through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-published-its-final-resolvability-testing-guidelines" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA Guidelines on resolvability testing</a>, and simulations are becoming more prevalent in ensuring preparation among authorities, the EBA&rsquo;s Handbook proposes a taxonomy for simulation exercises for resolution authorities to harmonise the use of main concepts within the financial stability framework.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​In addition, the Handbook distinguishes between testing, simulations and dry runs and introduces six main types of simulation exercise: brainstorms, desktop exercises, walkthroughs, fire drills, decision-making exercises and operational simulations. This new chapter also presents the concept of end-to-end simulations, which combine multiple exercise types to replicate real-world resolution scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​The Handbook describes in operational terms how to initiate, plan, prepare and deliver a simulation exercise. It provides practical guidance on defining objectives and scope, designing scenarios, allocating resources, managing delivery, and collecting feedback. The Handbook also includes templates and examples to support authorities in implementing effective and proportionate simulation exercises.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>​Legal basis and background&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>​This initiative is part of the EBA&rsquo;s broader mandate under Article 8(1)(ab) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to maintain an up-to-date Union resolution handbook. The Handbook draws on the experience of resolution authorities across the EU and aims to foster convergence, interoperability and cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​Simulation exercises are a key tool for resolution authorities to test and refine their internal procedures, decision-making processes and coordination mechanisms as well as to train their staff.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​The Handbook is available on the EBA&rsquo;s website and is intended for use by all resolution authorities in the EU. It complements the EBA&rsquo;s existing Guidalines on resolvability testing and supports the ongoing development of a robust and credible resolution framework.&nbsp;</p>

<title>AI: A Fed Policymaker's View, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa D. Cook, At The National Bureau Of Economic Research, Summer Institute 2025: Digital Economics And Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge, Massachusetts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Avi. It is an honor to be back with you at the NBER Summer Institute. Thanks to you, Erik, and Catherine for organizing these insightful and thought-provoking sessions this summer.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is advancing across the globe and permeating every corner of the economy at an incredibly rapid rate. This has significant implications for Federal Reserve leaders, both as policymakers and managers of the organization. AI is transforming the economy, including by accelerating how quickly we generate ideas and making workers more efficient, and that, in turn, will affect both sides of our dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. AI also is beginning to affect the way we conduct economic research within the Federal Reserve System, with the potential to make some tasks more efficient, harness nontraditional data in new ways, and broaden and deepen economic analysis.</p>
<p>I believe we are at an inflection point. As I have stated before, I, like some of you here today, see AI as the next general-purpose technology (GPT)<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>. As many of you in this room know and have written about, GPTs, like the printing press or electric power, matter immensely to innovation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;Similar to those seminal advances, AI will likely spread throughout the economy more broadly, spark innovation, and improve over time.</p>
<p>Among large language models (LLMs), the highest scores on benchmark intelligence tests have almost doubled over the past 12 months, according to the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;The competition to improve is fierce: The leaderboard for the AI lab offering the best model switched six times in the past half a year. And the technology is diffusing rapidly. ChatGPT launched about three years ago, and now more than half a billion users engage with the internet-based LLM weekly.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;LLMs are super cool and grab the headlines, but there is a lot more to AI, which can be an important driver of productivity. Advances in multimedia generation is another way to think of AI's fast advancement. It took human creators decades to move from silent pictures to "talkie" movies; AI models accomplished this advance in less than a year.</p>
<p>AI is poised to alter the contours of the global economy. In doing so, it has the potential to materially affect both sides of the Fed's dual mandate. On the maximum-employment side of the mandate, AI can generate new tasks and jobs and possibly eliminate others, similar to many past technological innovations. On the price-stability side of our mandate, AI can improve productivity, which can lower inflationary pressures, but it can also boost prices in the interim, as AI adoption may lead to a surge in aggregate investment. Studying the net effects of AI on the economy over time will be critical to setting appropriate monetary policy. However, at the Fed, we are not only considering AI's implications for the economy but also employing strategies to harness the technology's power inside our walls.</p>
<p>Commensurate with rapid improvements in AI, its adoption is accelerating across government and industry. As a result, there is an urgency for the Fed to both study AI's effects and capture more of its benefits to maintain a highly productive workforce and extract additional insights from new economic analysis.</p>
<p>Having spent much of my career studying the innovation production function and collecting and examining data on the economic effects of technology, productivity, and innovation, I am coupling caution with this optimism. This is consistent with my view when I was a research associate here at NBER and when I first spoke about AI at the NBER AI meeting in Toronto in 2018 before I joined the Board of Governors. While I see AI adoption as broadly beneficial to the economy and society, I know from economic history and the history of technology that there could be many multidimensional challenges to adopting it. With that in mind, I will start by offering general principles I believe guide our society's engagement with AI. Next, I will describe recent progress on AI research at the Fed. I will then say a bit about both the opportunities and constraints I see affecting the wider adoption of AI. Finally, I will offer some brief remarks on how AI factors into my thinking on monetary policy.</p>
<p><span>Responsible AI Adoption</span><br />I want to start by stressing that any organization engaging with this technology should take a thoughtful and structured approach to AI adoption. I can offer four guiding principles for what I view as responsible AI adoption.</p>
<p>First and foremost is establishing strong governance and risk management. A central tenet of good governance should be the mindset that humans are in the loop, because it ensures that people guide AI rather than allow AI to guide us. In a speech last year, I told a story about how Benjamin Franklin lost a game of chess to a machine called the "Mechanical Turk"<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Of course, there was a human chess master hidden inside. What might seem like a silly tale contains an important lesson for organizations and governments deploying AI: Like the Mechanical Turk, ultimately the human inside the machine is still in charge. Relatedly, organizations also must be careful about privacy, cybersecurity, and leakage of confidential and internal information.</p>
<p>A second principle is that education and training of staff are critical to get and keep employees at the technological frontier. A third principle is empowerment. Teams within organizations should be encouraged to learn by doing and engage hands-on with AI technologies in controlled environments. Finally, a fourth principle is experimentation. Organizations should maintain a spirit of openness while retaining the ability to halt projects that do not meet rigorous standards.</p>
<p><span>AI Research at the Fed</span><br />Like many other leading organizations and researchers around the world, the Federal Reserve is working hard to understand AI's implications for our mission and our own work. To be clear, the FOMC is not using AI in developing or setting policy, but rather to aid staff in their other tasks such as writing, coding, and research. For example, we have been deepening our understanding of the capabilities of LLMs and other machine learning models to produce economic insights.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Several Fed papers document what we are learning. Board economists Wendy Dunn and Nitish Sinha, with coauthors Ellen Meade and Raakin Kabir found that LLMs have surprisingly good understanding of economic topics discussed in the FOMC minutes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;In a recent paper, Board economist Paul Soto measured AI research and development by examining firms' earnings conference calls using deep learning.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a>&nbsp;Richmond Fed economist Anne Hansen, with coauthors, John Horton, Sophia Kazinnik, Daniela Puzzello and Ali Zarifhonarvar found partial success in simulating the Survey of Professional Forecasters' panel using an LLM and create synthetic forecasters that often achieve superior accuracy, particularly at medium- and long-term horizons.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;A paper by Mary Chen, Matthew DeHaven, Isabel Kitschelt, Seung Jung Lee, and Martin Sicilian used machine learning techniques on a variety of unstructured textual data to identify and forecast financial crises.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;Another paper, by Leland Crane, Emily Green, Molly Harnish, Will McClennan, Paul Soto, Betsy Vrankovich, and Jacob Williams, harnessed the ability of an open-weight model to read Work Adjustment and Retraining Notifications to create a real-time measure of layoffs.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;As our researchers examine LLMs and other machine learning techniques critically, some research has demonstrated the benefits of AI, and other research has provided important insights about its limits and where we should be careful about AI.</p>
<p>By actively engaging with and learning about AI tools in our research, we not only enhance our analytical capabilities, but also gain invaluable insights into the broader economic implications of AI. Researchers at the Fed are also examining the state of AI adoption and the potential of AI to affect our economy. A timely indicator of generative AI (GenAI) adoption in the U.S. has been developed by St. Louis Fed economist Alexander Bick, along with his coauthors Adam Blandin and David Deming, through a repeated survey.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;They also find that, so far, GenAI adoption for uses outside of work has been faster than personal computer (PC) adoption after its introduction. In the workplace, they find GenAI adoption has happened at a similar pace as occurred with PCs. Work from David Byrne and Paul Soto, along with coauthors Martin Baily and Aidan Kane, suggests that GenAI has the potential to be a GPT and could benefit the economy in other ways too such as by being an invention that itself leads to more innovation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>In addition, Fed staff from across our divisions keep abreast with the rapid developments in GenAI by engaging regularly with other researchers and experts from academia, other central banks, and the industry through various seminars, workshops, interviews, and invited presentation series.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the research at the Fed is proceeding deliberately and cautiously, as many AI tools are not yet ready to be put into production. For example, Leland Crane, Akhil Karra and Paul Soto show that when it comes to real-time analysis, LLMs suffer from look-ahead bias and frequently get confused by the vintage nature of economic data releases.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Even for historical analysis, the researchers note: "From the perspective of historical analysis, an LLM may not reliably recall the details of real time data flow during historical episodes, limiting the reliability of historical analysis."</p>
<p><span>The Speed of Adoption</span><br />Our experience with AI at the Fed is also informative about why we are not seeing more widespread adoption of AI in the economy, despite its remarkable pace of improvement and the apparently large potential economic gains.</p>
<p>First, as in all industries grappling with AI, the workforce must be trained to take advantage of a rapidly changing technology that is strikingly different from previous technologies. Often, the premise of technology has been to automate routine tasks where the steps involved are predetermined. The premise of AI is different from technologies of the past. AI promises to augment areas of work involving human judgement, which do not follow any predetermined steps. Thus, education and training must evolve.</p>
<p>Second, large organizations learn to use new tools through hands-on experimentation and shared experiences, and it takes time for the knowledge to diffuse. Some of these are planned and organized, while others are more organic and spontaneous. For example, earlier this year, the Board hosted an AI expo where AI early adopters shared their experiences with AI and innovative AI use cases. Events such as this showcase cross-functional, cross-organizational collaboration among participants throughout the Federal Reserve System and demonstrate how AI-driven solutions could address challenges in areas such as economic analysis, financial stability, and operations. These venues provide excellent avenues for sharing successes and failures in trying out different use cases and, in many cases, enable the broader community to engage with prototypes of AI applications. In addition to demystifying AI and encouraging its use, these events try to establish and promote cultural norms of responsible AI usage, which generates ideas related to the types of problems AI is better or worse at solving.</p>
<p>Finally, organizations will also have a rational desire to be selective about which advances to adopt when the technology is rapidly changing. For example, we are seeing that some highly effective prompting strategies for older models are no longer necessary for thinking models. As with any new general-purpose technology, there is likely to be an extended period of learning by doing. This will be particularly important for the high-profile LLM models. With these models, even the developers are not fully aware of their capabilities, and organizations, including the Fed, learn about their abilities and limitations only once they are put to use.</p>
<p><span>Implications for Monetary Policy</span><br />Given what we know, as well as what we learn from researchers like you, we are thinking carefully about the implications of AI for monetary policy. As AI filters through the economy, it has the potential to affect both sides of our dual mandate in different ways.</p>
<p>As with other technological innovations, AI is poised to reshape our labor market, which in turn could affect our notion of maximum employment or our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. I see it as likely that AI will allow workers to be more productive while also changing the tasks associated with any given job. As with many technological breakthroughs, a certain set of jobs may be replaced. We must recognize the challenges and potential pain this may bring, and we are watching this closely. A successful response to these disruptions will be of paramount importance but lies outside the mandate of monetary policy. Fortunately, new types of employment, whether tasks or occupations, are also being created.</p>
<p>In terms of price stability, AI is likely to boost productivity and could help the economy achieve higher growth while reducing inflationary pressures, because those productivity improvements can counter labor cost increases. In addition, the ability of AI to process and analyze ever larger amounts of data will likely lead to advances in scientific research and innovation, resulting in an increased arrival rate of ideas, further amplifying its effect on productivity. As I have noted in recent speeches, it is possible that the disinflationary effect of AI could, over time, counter any factors putting upward pressure on inflation.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/cook20250717a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;It is also possible that AI could boost prices in the interim, as adoption of the technology might require a surge in aggregate investment.</p>
<p>I am constantly monitoring incoming data, the ever-evolving outlook, and a broad range of risks to both sides of the dual mandate. I tend to be cautiously optimistic when I anticipate what AI could bring to the economy, but much uncertainty remains. As I have laid out for my institution specifically and the economy broadly, AI is a technology that is rapidly evolving, and it is good to be humble about our understanding of its exact effects on our economy and the timing of those effects.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />To conclude, I see us at a moment of inflection where AI is being deployed as a general-purpose technology. Babies born today will ask what life was like before LLMs, just as today's college students quiz us about what life was like before the internet and mobile phones. This is a moment for excitement and optimism, but also one we are taking seriously at the Federal Reserve. As I have described, AI will both change the economy for which we set policy and change how we can best operate as a central bank.</p>
<p>Much more remains to be learned and understood about how AI will affect our economy and our everyday lives. This is why gatherings and discussions like these in the 48th session of the NBER Summer Institute are so important. I am excited to learn about the careful and insightful research presented by former colleagues, graduate students, and many others at the Summer Institute, and I look forward to listening to the remaining discussions today.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<title>Office Of The Comptroller Of The US Currency Announces Enforcement Actions For July 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-us-currency-announces-enforcement-actions-for-j-2025717/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/office-of-the-comptroller-of-the-us-currency-announces-enforcement-actions-for-j-2025717/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today released enforcement actions taken against national banks and federal savings associations (banks), and individuals currently and formerly affiliated with banks the OCC supervises.</p>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against banks to require the board of directors and management to take timely actions to correct the deficient practices or violations identified.</p>
<ul>
<li>The OCC does not have any enforcement actions against banks to release in July.</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC uses enforcement actions against an institution-affiliated party (IAP) to deter, encourage correction of, or prevent violations, unsafe or unsound practices, or breaches of fiduciary duty. Enforcement actions against IAPs reinforce the accountability of individuals for their conduct regarding the affairs of a bank. The term &ldquo;institution-affiliated party,&rdquo; or IAP, is defined in 12 USC 1813(u) and includes bank directors, officers, employees, and controlling shareholders. Orders of Prohibition prohibit an individual from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-27.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Lacey Ann Henry,</span>&nbsp;former Teller Manager at a Trooper, Pennsylvania, branch of T.D. Bank, N.A., Wilmington, Delaware, for making unauthorized cash withdrawals, totaling over $41,000, from customer checking accounts. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-27)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-24.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Alonso Missael Gonzalez Ibarra,</span>&nbsp;former Teller and Lead Associate Operations at a Portland, Oregon, branch of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Columbus, Ohio, for stealing approximately $36,000 from ATMs and altering totals in the ATM records to make the ATMs appear to be in balance. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-24)</li>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-23.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against Cricel Santamaria,</span>&nbsp;former Client Service Representative at Webster Bank, N.A., Stamford, Connecticut, for obtaining images of checks from the bank&rsquo;s internal systems, making the images available for sale, and causing over $100,000 in loss to the bank. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-23)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC issues prohibition/suspension orders against individuals in response to certain criminal conduct. Pursuant to 12 USC 1818(g), in the case of a conviction against an IAP related to certain criminal violations, the OCC will issue an order prohibiting the IAP from any participation in the affairs of a bank or other institution as defined in 12 USC 1818(e)(7). The OCC has taken the following actions against IAPs:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-37.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order of Prohibition</a>&nbsp;against James P. Blose,</span>&nbsp;former General Counsel at Webster Bank, N.A., Stamford, Connecticut, based on his conviction for bank fraud and engaging in illegal monetary transactions in violation of law. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-37)</li>
</ul>
<p>The OCC terminates enforcement actions when a bank has demonstrated compliance with all articles of an enforcement action; or when the OCC determines that articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; have become outdated or irrelevant to the bank&rsquo;s current circumstances; or when the OCC incorporates the articles deemed &ldquo;not in compliance&rdquo; into a new action. Termination actions include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/eaAA-ENF-2025-39.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Order terminating the Cease and Desist Order against GN Bank</a>,</span>&nbsp;Chicago, Illinois, dated September 18, 2020 (<a href="https://www.occ.gov/static/enforcement-actions/ea2020-053.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Docket No. AA-EC-2020-50</a>). The order addressed unsafe or unsound practices related to strategic and capital planning, credit risk management, and governance. (Docket No. AA-ENF-2025-39)</li>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Alleges Breach Of Alberta Securities Laws By Crypto Asset Trading Platform Catalx CTS Ltd. And Its CEO And CFO</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-alleges-breach-of-alberta-securities-laws-by-crypt-2025717/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/alberta-securities-commission-alleges-breach-of-alberta-securities-laws-by-crypt-2025717/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) has issued a Notice of Hearing against CatalX CTS Ltd. (operating as Catalyx), Hyuek Jae Park (Park) and Jae Ho Lee (Lee). At the time of the alleged misconduct, Lee was chief financial officer and Park was chief executive officer of Catalyx.</p>
<p>The Notice of Hearing alleges that Lee perpetrated a fraud on Catalyx clients and that Catalyx failed to comply with a written undertaking it had given the ASC to permit it to continue operating in Canada while its application for registration as an authorized crypto asset trading platform (CTP) was being reviewed by the Commission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time of the alleged misconduct, CTPs operating in Canada were required to sign a pre-registration undertaking in order to continue operations while their application for registration was under review. As part of the undertaking, CTPs were required to comply with terms and conditions to address investor protection concerns. More information about the regulation of CTPs is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.securities-administrators.ca/crypto-trading-platforms-regulation-and-enforcement-actions/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">available on the Canadian Securities Administrators website</a>.</p>
<p>According to the Notice of Hearing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beginning in February 2019, Lee improperly withdrew at least $14,030,000 CAD worth of clients&rsquo; crypto assets from the Catalyx CTP, and transferred them to accounts he controlled at other CTPs. Lee subsequently returned some crypto assets to the Catalyx CTP, leaving it with a substantial shortfall. Lee also misappropriated clients&rsquo; fiat currency deposits for unauthorized purposes.</li>
<li>By November 24, 2023, Park was aware that Lee perpetrated a fraud on clients of Catalyx, but Catalyx failed to inform the ASC of this material breach of the written undertaking until December 21, 2023.</li>
<li>In further breach of the written undertaking, Catalyx failed to establish, maintain and apply policies and procedures to manage and mitigate the risk of an employee misappropriating clients&rsquo; fiat currency and crypto assets that were meant to be held in trust for clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are allegations and have not been proven in a hearing.</p>
<p>An appearance to set a date for a hearing will be held on September 15, 2025 in the ASC Hearing Room, located on the 5th floor, 250 &ndash; 5 Street S.W., Calgary, Alberta.</p>
<p>A copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Notices-Decisions-Orders-Rulings/Enforcement/2025/07/CatalX-CTS-Ltd-NOH-20250711-6191842.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Notice of Hearing</a>&nbsp;can be found on the ASC website.</p>
<p>The ASC gratefully acknowledges the assistance of the BC Securities Commission, the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC), and the Financial Market Authority Liechtenstein.</p>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province&rsquo;s securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada&rsquo;s capital markets.</p>

<p>Thank you, Robin. And thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the important topic of housing and how housing fits in with the broader economy.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>First, I want to step back and say that housing&mdash;our homes&mdash;has a central role in our lives beyond what statistical reports capture. Housing matters greatly for our welfare because shelter is a basic human necessity. Our homes&mdash;be it city apartments, farmhouses passed through generations, or suburban dwellings&mdash;are among the most significant places in our lives. In terms of household finances, housing is an important source of wealth for many American families. Housing also supports access to good jobs, because the jobs people can take depend on where they live and how far they need to commute.</p>
<p>In addition, the housing sector matters a great deal to the economy as a whole, and it is an important channel through which monetary policy is transmitted. That is why I study it closely as a member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). From the perspective of the labor market, many workers have ties to housing-related sectors, including construction, real estate, and the mortgage finance industry. And because housing is a large fraction of household wealth, the housing market influences consumer spending. From the price-stability perspective, shelter has a large weight in measures of inflation. Specifically, shelter is currently 16 percent of the expenditures in the basket used to calculate the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which is the FOMC's preferred inflation measure.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Today I will discuss several aspects of housing affordability in the U.S., a topic that I know is important to many of you, as it is to me. When studying affordability, it is important to distinguish between the cost of shelter, by which I mean the cost of occupying a home, and the costs of purchasing and owning a home. I will discuss each of these in turn, with the common theme being that both are elevated from a historical perspective. Next, I will discuss some supply and demand factors that explain how we got to this point and offer some thoughts on how these influences might evolve. Finally, I will discuss my overall outlook of the U.S. economy and its implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p><span>Cost of Shelter</span><br />I will start with a discussion of the cost of shelter, which is not only needed for survival, but is also a large portion of household budgets. Because of this, increases in shelter prices leave less for families to spend otherwise. It is common to measure the price of shelter with rents because rent reflects the price of occupying a home. Rents surged early in the pandemic recovery, rising 8.3 percent over the 12 months ending in December 2022. This year, rent growth eased to 3.8 percent over the 12 months ending in May.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;The recent increase in multifamily construction has contributed to this moderation. For lower-end properties, we have not seen as much of a cooling in rental inflation, in part because new construction has been aimed at the high end of the market. Even with the slowdown in rent growth, rents continue to rise faster than overall inflation, as was the case before the pandemic.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>Nevertheless, rents have not risen at a faster pace than household incomes. The constant-quality cost of a rental unit relative to the median family income is currently no higher than its average from 2014 to 2019. The share of renters spending more than 30 percent of their income on rent was about the same in 2023 as it was in 2019, about 40 percent in both years. Of course, this fraction is high, indicating that rental housing is a large expense for many families. This ratio is significantly higher for certain groups. In 2023, 43 percent of Hispanic households spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent, while 47 percent of Black households spent that share. For households whose head did not attend college, the figure is 46 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p><span>Cost of Homeownership</span><br />While shelter is a necessity, homeownership is an opportunity because it is a pathway for families to build wealth. It also provides a greater sense of stability because owner-occupants do not have to worry about a landlord deciding not to renew the lease. Like renting, the costs of purchasing and owning a house are elevated.</p>
<p>The cost of homeownership is related to several factors. One is the cost of purchasing a home. Like rent, house price growth has slowed from the fast pace seen a few years ago, and this slowing has been more pronounced for higher-priced homes. Zillow's index for high-value homes increased 1 percent per year over the past three years, whereas it increased 3 percent per year for low-value homes.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Despite this slowdown, the level of prices is quite high, even relative to income. The ratio of house prices to median family income is about 20 percent higher than its average from 2014 to 2019.</p>
<p>In addition, the costs associated with owning a home are also elevated. Mortgage rates have ranged between 6 and 7.5 percent in the past several years. Property taxes have risen along with home values. Homeowners insurance premiums have increased as insurers seek to offset expenditures tied to recent natural disasters and the rising cost of replacing structures. Federal Reserve Board staff research shows that, factoring in high house prices, mortgage rates, property taxes, and homeowners' insurance, the costs of owning a home relative to median income in 2023 were at the highest level seen since 1980.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p>Given these costs, it is no surprise that some families cannot afford a home. Board staff research shows that increases in mortgage rates reduce purchases by lower-income borrowers, especially low-income first-time homebuyers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a>&nbsp;And, indeed, the homeownership rate of heads of households younger than 45 decreased from 2022 to 2024. This decline is a partial reversal of changes seen in the previous few years when a combination of very low interest rates and fiscal support caused ownership rates to rise. Yet, on net, the ownership rate for several groups remains above levels recorded before the pandemic. In 2024, homeownership rates for household heads aged 35 to 44 were 62 percent, 2 percentage points above their 2019 level. The ownership rates for Black households were 4 percentage points higher, and the rate for Hispanic households was 1.5 percentage points higher.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p><span>Demand Factors</span><br />The relative affordability of housing is the outcome of the forces of supply and demand. Let me first focus on the long-run trends on the demand side, where household growth&mdash;that is, the change in the number of households over time&mdash;plays an important role. Household growth is a function of population growth and household size. In the 10 years before the pandemic, the U.S. population rose slightly less than 1 percent a year. Immediately following the pandemic, population grew at a faster rate, reflecting a higher volume of immigration. That trend has since reversed. Academic research examining immigration flows finds that rent growth increases in the short run after a wave of immigration, but these rent increases may not persist if the housing supply expands over time to meet the increase in housing demand.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;In fact, a study found that increases in immigration do lead to more residential construction.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;In terms of the whole population, the Census Bureau projects that population growth will ease over the next 10 years but remain positive, based on mortality rates, birth rates, and the age distribution of the population.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;Thus, population growth should put less upward pressure on demand for housing going forward.</p>
<p>Let me turn to some cyclical forces on the housing demand side, with some factors pushing demand in opposite directions. A strong labor market for several years has fueled demand for both renting and owning housing, while the recent increase in mortgage rates and other costs of ownership have damped demand for owning.</p>
<p><span>Supply Factors</span><br />Turning to housing supply, it is no surprise to those in this room that it has been increasing at too slow of a rate relative to demand. Research shows that growth of the housing stock has declined steadily since the 1960s and 1970s. Specifically, it estimates that if the housing stock had expanded at the same rate from 2000 to 2020 as it did from 1980 to 2000, there would be 15 million more housing units in the U.S.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a></p>
<p>Research finds that local regulations are an important factor constraining the housing supply, leading to higher house prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a>&nbsp;In response, some state and local governments have begun to enact policy changes aimed at relaxing these supply restrictions. For example, in 2020 Minneapolis enacted a large-scale zoning reform that eliminated parking requirements for new development, encouraged apartment development in commercial corridors, and permitted duplex and triplex construction on all residential lots. These zoning reforms may have boosted construction in Minneapolis. Other states and cities have also implemented policies intended to increase the number of housing units, but it is still too early to tell whether these changes will meaningfully affect house prices or rents.</p>
<p>Material and labor costs for home construction have increased about 25 percent in real terms since the mid-2000s.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Recent policy changes at the national level could further increase those costs. Anecdotal reports, including those in the Beige Book, suggest that changes in immigration policy are starting to restrict the supply of construction workers. Research has found that past declines in immigration have reduced residential construction while increasing housing prices.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;In terms of tariff policy changes, to date there has been some effect on homebuilder costs. The National Association of Home Builders estimates tariff policy, including tariffs on steel and aluminum, has increased the cost of new construction by about 3 percent of the average price of a new home, and additional tariffs, such as the one proposed on imported lumber, could raise construction costs further.</p>
<p>Another aspect of housing supply is the number of homes for sale. Elevated interest rates have made it much less appealing for existing owners who have a mortgage with a low fixed rate to sell and purchase a different house, because doing so would require them to take out a new mortgage at a much higher rate. Therefore, the supply of existing homes for sale in the past few years has been much lower than normal. Board staff research shows that this "rate lock-in" effect has boosted house prices in markets that were already tight in 2019, because the decrease in homes for sale was proportionally larger than the decrease in the number of potential buyers.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a></p>
<p>Considering all these factors in concert, the housing market has gone through some pronounced swings over the past four years. Looking through these ups and downs, growth in demand for shelter has continued to outpace supply, putting upward pressure on rents across a wide range of locations and types of families. Although rent growth has not been faster than income growth, rental expenditures are still a large fraction of income for many households. House prices have risen, too, and combined with elevated mortgage rates and increases in other ownership costs, the costs of owning a home are high relative to Americans' incomes.</p>
<p>Looking forward, growth in housing demand may soften over the second half of this decade because of a slowdown in population growth. But even with this softening, it is not clear that growth in the housing supply will be large enough to meet demand. Prospects for house prices and rents over the next few years also depend materially on the economic outlook, to which I will turn now.</p>
<p><span>Economic Outlook</span><br />I will start by saying that while my discussion so far has focused on the housing market, I look at economic conditions across the entire economy and in every region of the country when making monetary policy decisions. Thus, I pursue the monetary policy that I believe will achieve our dual-mandate goals of maximum employment and price stability for all Americans.</p>
<p>Overall, I see the labor market as stable and resilient, and economic activity moderating some. In contrast, I see upward pressure on inflation from trade policies, and I expect additional price increases later in the year. While I am monitoring policy developments in many areas, I continue to see trade developments as the key drivers of the U.S. economic outlook.</p>
<p>Starting with price stability, based on data received this week, it is estimated that the headline PCE price index rose 2.5 percent on a 12-month basis in June, a somewhat stronger gain than the 2.3 percent recorded in May. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs and is a good guide for future inflation, came in at about 2.8 percent in June, also higher than in May. Both headline and core inflation have shown no progress in the last six months. While core services inflation decreased relative to the end of last year, core goods inflation has pushed up inflation recently.</p>
<p>I see firmer core goods inflation as already partially reflecting the pass-through of increased tariffs, which has been shown by research done at the Fed.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn18" title="footnote 18"><span>18</span></a><a name="f18"></a>&nbsp;In addition, CPI and PPI reports released in the past two days show that increases in core goods prices were more broad-based in the month of June. While many forecasters may have been expecting a sooner and sharper increase in overall inflation, there are many reasons to think that larger effects of tariffs are still coming. First, businesses built up inventories ahead of anticipated tariff increases, giving them leeway to still sell goods at pre-tariffed prices. Second, given the many changes in implemented tariff policies, businesses may not yet be passing the higher tariffs to their selling prices because they are waiting for greater clarity. Third, businesses, especially larger ones, may also be waiting to capture market share from others that hike prices sooner. Fourth, the current environment of still-elevated short-run inflation expectations makes it easier for workers to seek higher wages and business to charge higher prices, which could increase the persistence of price hikes going forward. Fifth, tariff rates could increase further, as seen in newly proposed reciprocal tariffs for several countries and the new tariffs on copper introduced last week, putting further upward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Other unforeseen shocks, such as geopolitical ones, may further push inflation upward soon. Board staff research shows that increased geopolitical risk is associated with high inflation in the U.S., with effects peaking about two years after the geopolitical shock.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/kugler20250717a.htm#fn19" title="footnote 19"><span>19</span></a><a name="f19"></a>&nbsp;Renewed tensions in the Middle East, together with the possibility of an extension and escalation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, are important geopolitical risks to monitor.</p>
<p>Turning to the employment side of our mandate, I see a labor market that has been stable and resilient. The June employment report showed that employers added a robust 147,000 jobs, boosted by jobs in the state and local government sector. Private payroll employment increased by 74,000, showing some moderation relative to previous months. Additionally, the unemployment rate has stayed in a narrow and historically low range for more than a year. Layoff measures have remained subdued, and the ratio of job vacancies to unemployed workers has largely been stable at a level that suggests demand and supply for labor are roughly balanced.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br />Considering the near-term outlook that I just outlined, I see that the U.S. economy has remained resilient, with labor markets appearing to be stable and close to full employment. Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the FOMC's 2 percent goal and is facing upward pressure from implemented tariffs. Moreover, I judge that inflation is likely to increase further as tariff effects build up during the rest of the year.</p>
<p>Given the stability in the employment side of our mandate, with the unemployment rate still at historically low levels, elevated short-run inflation expectations, and goods inflation rising due to the upward pressure from tariffs, I find it appropriate to hold our policy rate at the current level for some time. This still-restrictive policy stance is important to keep longer-run inflation expectations anchored. Moving forward, I will make policy decisions based on incoming economic data, the evolving outlook, and my assessment of risks to both sides of our dual mandate.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The 13<span>th</span>&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;<span>European Small and Mid-Cap Awards</span>&nbsp;will take place in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 11<span>th</span>&nbsp;November 2025, as part of the European Commission&rsquo;s annual SME Assembly.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Two individuals have been arrested on suspicion of money laundering and running an illegal cryptoasset exchange. &nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>As part of an operation led by the FCA and the Metropolitan Police Service, four premises across southwest London were searched. During the search, seven crypto ATMs were also found and seized by the FCA.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'If you&rsquo;re operating a crypto ATM or exchange illegally, then you should expect serious consequences. There are currently no legally-operated crypto ATMs in the UK, so using one only supports crime. We will continue to partner with law enforcement agencies to fight financial crime and protect consumers.'</p>
<p>Detective Inspector Geoff Donoghue, of the Met&rsquo;s Cryptocurrency Team, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Our team is committed to working alongside our partners to address the growing threat of the misuse of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>'As cryptocurrency usage evolves, so does our efforts to safeguard our communities. This operation with the FCA shows our determination to keep Londoners safe from financial criminals.'</p>
<p>It is illegal to operate a cryptoasset exchange or a crypto ATM in the UK without FCA registration. Failure to comply with money laundering regulations is also a criminal offence.</p>
<p>The two suspects were interviewed under caution and released under investigation while enquiries continue.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Since 10 January 2021, cryptoasset businesses providing certain cryptoasset services in the UK must be registered with the FCA under the Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017 (MLRs).</li>
<li>Cryptoasset businesses must be registered with the FCA under the MLRs, and comply with the requirements of the regulations, if they intend to provide certain cryptoasset services by way of business, and in the UK.</li>
<li>Under the MLRs the FCA can impose directions on cryptoasset businesses which can prohibit them from operating. It is a criminal offence to breach a direction imposed under the MLRs.</li>
<li>The FCA publishes a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/consumers/warning-list-unauthorised-firms" title="FCA Warning List of unauthorised firms">list of businesses</a>&nbsp;that it suspects are operating without our registration.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>It is the eighth company to register an Initial Access Document on the growth markets of BME market so far this year</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Market Coordination and Listing Committee considers that&nbsp;<span>Inmobiliaria Marbella SOCIMI</span>&nbsp;will meet the requirements for listing on BME Scaleup. It is the eighth company to register an Initial Market Access Document (DIAM) on this BME market.</p>
<p>The company's Board of Directors has taken a reference price of 4 euros per share as a reference for the start of trading, taking into account the valuation report prepared by an independent expert, which represents a total value of the company of 20 million euros.</p>
<p>The company's Registered Advisor is&nbsp;<span>Renta 4 Sigrun</span>.</p>
<p><span>Inmobiliaria Marbella&nbsp;</span>is a family-owned company that has been operating since 1984 and is dedicated to real estate development, sales, and property rentals, primarily focused on the province of M&aacute;laga, Spain. The Company's model is based on maximising income from long-term rentals, as well as the profitability of its owned assets, offering investors the opportunity to invest in real assets of various types in the Spanish real estate market with minimal possible risk.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>Inmobiliaria Marbella&rsquo;s</span>&nbsp;Information Document is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup website</a>, where you can find all the information about the company and its business.</p>
<p>The growth markets of BME (BME Growth and BME Scaleup) are aimed at small and medium-sized enterprises. In 2024, these markets welcomed 23 new companies and now have more than 150 companies listed for trading.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bmegrowth.es/ing/Home.aspx">BME Growth</a>&nbsp;allows small-cap companies from all sectors, with a significant presence of technology companies, to finance their growth, with recurring access to capital increases and a broad base of national and international investors. For its part,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bolsasymercados.es/MTF_Equity/bme-scaleup/ing/Home.aspx">BME Scaleup</a>&nbsp;is especially oriented towards scaleups, although it is also open to other types of companies such as SMEs, REITs, or family businesses. This market adapts to the needs of these companies by relaxing the incorporation requirements while offering the necessary transparency to investors. Among the advantages of accessing capital markets for small and medium-sized enterprises are financing, reputation, visibility, a boost to inorganic growth, and greater ease in attracting and retaining talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With these growth markets, BME completes its service offering. BME has a market for every type of company, from the first approaches to capital markets with the formation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.entornopremercado.es/ing/Home">Pre-Market Environment</a>, to large companies listed on the Stock Exchange.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="p--heading-1">In July, Eurex fully implemented its new, first-of-its-kind Liquidity Provider (LP) program. The initiative aims to further enhance liquidity and efficiency in the flagship EURO STOXX 50&reg;&nbsp;Index Options (OESX and SX5E).Strong market-maker support from the community boosted the scheme, leading to a significant increase in liquidity coverage and order book interactions. In this article, Strahinja Trenkic, Quantitative Analyst in Market &amp; Liquidity Analytics at Eurex, shares his thoughts on the scheme and its early promise.</p>

<p class="p--heading-3">How has the launch of the new OESX LP scheme progressed so far ?</p>
<p>The rollout has gone very well. We spent two months testing prior before fully implementing the scheme on 1 July 2025, giving us and the LPs the chance to test systems and deploy the functionality. The response from the LPs has been outstanding. First and foremost, I want to thank all our partners involved in this scheme. It has been demanding period of testing and investing in systems to meet the new performance standards. Everyone at Eurex sincerely appreciates the proactive and constructive approach taken by our counterparts. Their engagement is a clear testament to the importance and quality of what this new program offers, as well as a genuine commitment to the ongoing success of our markets.</p>

<title>BME: The Companies Of The IBEX 35® Reduce Their Treasury Stock After Increasing Their Amortizations By 20.4% To A New Record</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><span>The number of treasury shares on the balance sheets of Spanish blue-chip companies decreases by 34% in 2024, but their market value rises by 8.9% due to stock market revaluation</span></li>
<li><span>Major listed companies increase share buybacks to 15.359 billion euros in 2024, the highest annual figure in history</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The treasury stock of IBEX 35&reg; companies, that is, the number of own shares on the balance sheets of listed companies, decreased by 34% at the end of 2024 to 579 million shares. This is the lowest figure in five years and is mainly due to the record-high growth in share buybacks, which companies increasingly use as a method of shareholder remuneration and to adjust their financial structure. These are two of the conclusions from the latest report by the BME Research Department, published today.</p>
<p>Although the total number of treasury shares held by major listed companies has fallen, their market value has increased by 8.9%, due to the revaluation of the IBEX 35&reg;. The total value of the treasury stock of these companies amounts to 7.2 billion euros, representing almost 1% of the total market capitalization of the index, based on data as of the end of last year.</p>
<p>ArcelorMittal, with 9.8% of its capital in treasury shares; ACS, with 6.2%; and Amadeus, with 3.1%, are the companies with the largest treasury stock.</p>
<p>The main reason for the average decline in treasury stock among IBEX 35&reg; companies is the steady growth in share buybacks. Last year, the value of shares repurchased by major listed companies reached 15.3 billion euros, a historic high and 20.4% more than in 2023. Banks were the main drivers of this trend, allocating 5.4 billion euros to repurchase their own shares under programmes announced in 2024, 25% more than the previous year.</p>
<p>The use of share buybacks as a method of shareholder remuneration, historically widespread in the United States, has grown significantly in recent years on the Spanish stock market, especially since 2021. Between January 2022 and June 2025, shares worth nearly 47.3 billion euros were repurchased on the Spanish stock market, compared to approximately 32 billion euros in the previous 10 years.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the preferred method of shareholder remuneration for listed companies remains dividend distribution. In the first half of 2025, dividends amounted to 21.2 billion euros, an 8.9% increase compared to the same period the previous year.</p>

<title>An Open Letter From The World Federation Of Exchanges - Revitalising Public Markets: A Global Imperative For Growth</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/an-open-letter-from-the-world-federation-of-exchanges-revitalising-public-mark-2025717/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To Policymakers, Regulators, Market Participants, and the Global Investment Community,<br /><br />Public markets are at a critical juncture.<br /><br />The latest data from the World Federation of Exchanges confirms a troubling reality: the number of initial public offerings (IPOs) globally has fallen to its lowest level in five years. This is especially stark in the EMEA and APAC regions, even as the Americas - and notably the United States&mdash;continue to demonstrate the vitality and power of public markets, as long as they are effectively supported and embraced.<br /><br />This decline is not just a statistical anomaly - it is symptomatic of a broader complacency about the vitality and durability of public markets. The rise of private capital and alternative asset classes such as cryptocurrencies, coupled with declining liquidity and valuations across many markets, including developed markets, has led to a worrying dislocation. Companies are staying private longer or bypassing public markets entirely. Investors are looking elsewhere. And, as a result, the fundamental role of public markets in supporting innovation, job creation, and equitable wealth distribution is under threat. All markets, especially private markets, rely on public markets.<br /><br />We write today not simply to raise the alarm, but to sound a call to action.<br /><br />Public exchanges are foundational to economic prosperity, giving people a path to financial security, via participation in shares of companies that drive economic growth or innovation. They enable permanent capital formation, transparency, protect investors, and create access to opportunity. From small domestic bourses to the largest global exchange groups, our members offer an inclusive pathway for businesses to raise capital to support future growth, to diversify its shareholder base, for individuals to invest and participate in wealth creation, and for societies to thrive. The health of the public exchange provides a clear signal on the financial health of a country.<br /><br />The decline in public listings and trading activity should concern everyone who cares about inclusive economic growth, even for participants of private markets. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We believe passionately that revitalising public markets is not just desirable - it is essential.<br /><br />Our members pledge to lead this global revitalisation.<br /><br />We will launch a multi-year campaign to investigate and address the structural causes of public market decline, beginning with an urgent focus on the IPO drought. This campaign will be underpinned by deep research, cross-market collaboration, and policy engagement. Our goal is to restore vitality to public markets worldwide.<br /><br />We propose a series of areas for immediate exploration:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Public-Private Ecosystem Alignment:</strong>&nbsp;Rather than viewing private and public markets as adversaries, we will promote an ecosystem approach, fostering synergies and joint upward mobility.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Policy Incentives for IPOs:</strong>&nbsp;We will explore regulatory, fiscal, and procedural reforms to make going public more attractive for businesses of all sizes, particularly in underperforming regions. &nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Reducing Market Fragmentation:</strong>&nbsp;Healthy primary markets require empowered secondary markets, such that the powerful technology that exchanges use benefits the widest possible range of market participants.</li>
<li><strong>Risk and reward culture:</strong>&nbsp;We will promote a model that embraces calibrated risk taking, in the interests of long-term growth and household security, building on literacy programmes, the availability of independent research, the use of derivatives as well as securities, central clearing, and the high-quality data that only exchanges can provide.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Championing Trust Campaigns:&nbsp;</strong>We will investigate ways to build the reputation of public markets as safe, transparent, and value-generating arenas for investment and capital formation, and invest in the promotion of them.</li>
</ol>
<p><br />This is a global mission that requires global cooperation. We invite our member exchanges, policymakers, regulators, asset managers, and issuers to join us in shaping the future of public markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Our ambition is simple yet profound: to ensure that public markets remain a dynamic, inclusive engine of global economic progress for generations to come.<br /><br />Now is the time for bold leadership, shared vision, and unwavering commitment.<br /><br />Let us rise to this challenge - together.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br /><strong>Ms Nandini Sukumar</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, The World Federation of Exchanges<br /><strong>Mr Boon Chye Loh</strong>, Chairman, The WFE, Chief Executive Officer, SGX Group<br /><strong>Mr John McKenzie</strong>, Vice Chairman, The WFE, Chief Executive Officer, TMX Group Limited<br /><strong>Mr Bj&oslash;rn Sibbern</strong>, Working Committee Chairman, The WFE, Chief Executive Officer, SIX Group<br /><strong>Mr Gilson Finkelsztain</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, B3 - Brasil Bolsa Balc&atilde;o<br /><strong>Mr Greg Wojciechowski</strong>, President &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Bermuda Stock Exchange<br /><strong>Mr Korkmaz Ergun</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, Borsa Istanbul<br /><strong>Mr Craig Donohue</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, Cboe Global Markets<br /><strong>Mr Kendal Vroman</strong>, Chief Transformation Officer, CME Group<br /><strong>Dr Thomas Book</strong>, Member of the Executive Board, Deutsche B&ouml;rse AG<br /><strong>Mr Carlson Tong</strong>, Chairman, Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing (HKEX)<br /><strong>Mr Hiromi Yamaji</strong>, Group Chief Executive Officer, Japan Exchange Group<br /><strong>Dr Leila Fourie</strong>, Group Chief Executive Officer, Johannesburg Stock Exchange<br /><strong>Mr Eun-Bo Jeong</strong>, Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer, Korea Exchange<br /><strong>Ms Julie Becker</strong>, Chief Executive Officer, Luxembourg Stock Exchange<br /><strong>Mr Edward S.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span><span>The Derivatives Service Bureau (DSB), the golden global source of reference data for Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives, has published the 2025 Industry Consultation Final Report today with a focus on fairer allocation of costs and data access. The report relates to the DSB&rsquo;s Unique Product Identifier (UPI), OTC International Securities Identification Number (ISIN), and the Classification Financial Instrument code (CFI) services.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This report follows the DSB&rsquo;s 8</span><span><sup>th</sup></span><span>&nbsp;annual consultation with industry in May 2025, highlighting industry views and next steps, which will come into effect 1 January 2026:</span><span><br /></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><strong><span>Fairer Allocation of Cost Recovery across users</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;</span><span>Currently 75% of DSB users access services free of charge. Industry supported the principle of changes to ensure fair allocation of costs among users of DSB data. Additional analysis will be undertaken by the DSB Governance Advisory Committee on potential changes to user functionality and access to DSB data.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong><span>New &lsquo;Distributor&rsquo; User Type:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>The DSB will introduce a new fee-paying Distributor user type for distribution of free DSB data to end users.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span><strong><span>Extension of Intermediary Model:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;There was broad support to extend the existing Intermediary model to include all DSB fee-paying user types. An Intermediary is a non-fee paying user permitted to distribute paid-for DSB data to end users.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>PNGX Group Limited (<b>PNGX Group</b>), holding company of Papua </i><i>New Guinea&rsquo;s national stock exchange, welcomes Wednesday&rsquo;s statement by Hon. William Duma, Minister for State Enterprises, and his strong support for market development and the deepening of Papua New Guinea&rsquo;s capital markets. </i></p>
<p>Encouraging greater public and institutional participation in BSP Financial Group Limited (<b>BSP</b>) shareholdings is a positive step that broadens investment opportunities for all Papua New Guineans.</p>
<p>We also commend the Minister&rsquo;s support for investment through PNGX, which is essential for building a vibrant and inclusive financial ecosystem. The reaffirmation of intent to partially privatise quality state-owned enterprises through the capital market is especially encouraging. This approach promotes transparency, strengthens corporate governance, and provides the public with a chance to own a stake in nationally significant enterprises.</p>
<p>We welcome the acknowledgement that the private sector is well positioned to drive innovation, efficiency and ensure long-term value creation. A strong private sector, enabled by a functioning capital market on PNGX, is key to unlocking economic growth and longterm national prosperity.</p>
<p>We stand ready to support these initiatives and contribute to a robust, resilient, and accessible capital market for PNG&rsquo;s future.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Founded in 1983, IOSCO is the global standard-setter for securities market regulation. With more than 200 member institutions, IOSCO oversees over 95% of the world&rsquo;s financial markets. In this context, the chairmanship of AMERC represents a strategically significant position that underscores the growing influence of Emirati regulatory leadership in the global financial arena.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Commenting on the announcement, H.E. Mohamed Al Shorafa, Chairman of the SCA Board of Directors, stated:&ldquo;The election of Waleed Al Awadhi as Chair of the Africa and Middle East Regional Committee marks a significant milestone that underscores the UAE&rsquo;s growing global standing in the financial sector and the increasing international confidence in its role in advancing the regulatory landscape of capital markets.

It is a source of pride not only for the SCA, but for the country as a whole, as a strategic partner in shaping the future of the global economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The election of H.E.

<title>ASIC Cancels Seven Australian Credit Licences And Suspends One Australian Credit Licence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC has cancelled seven Australian credit licences and suspended one Australian credit licence for failing to hold Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA) membership.</p>
<p>Licensees are required by law to be a member of AFCA. AFCA membership gives consumers access to a free, fair, and independent dispute resolution scheme if a complaint cannot be resolved internally by a licensee.</p>
<p>From 24 March 2025 to 11 July 2025, ASIC cancelled or suspended the credit licences of:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capital House Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 11 July 2025</li>
<li><strong>David Anthony Ross &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence suspended 4 June 2025</li>
<li><strong>Glove Finance Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 25 March 2025</li>
<li><strong>JTan Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 31 March 2025</li>
<li><strong>M&amp;H Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 3 July 2025</li>
<li><strong>Oz Finance Professional Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 2 April 2025</li>
<li><strong>Peppermint Loans Pty Ltd &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 27 June 2025, and</li>
<li><strong>Sheree Nicole Becker &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>licence cancelled 27 June 2025.</li>
</ul>
<p>AFCA works with ASIC to identify credit licence holders that do not maintain AFCA membership.</p>
<p>If an entity is expelled from the scheme or requests to withdraw membership, AFCA must notify ASIC. Where an entity fails to comply, or is otherwise in breach of general conduct obligations, ASIC will continue to take action to cancel AFS licence or credit licences.</p>
<p>The licensees have varyingly:</p>
<ul>
<li>failed to be a member of AFCA</li>
<li>failed to lodge annual compliance certificates on time</li>
<li>failed to pay industry funding levies owed to ASIC</li>
<li>ceased to engage in credit activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The licensees have the right to appeal to the Administrative Review Tribunal for a review of ASIC&rsquo;s decision.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Under section 55 of the Credit Act, ASIC has the power to cancel a credit licence if a credit licence holder has contravened its general conduct obligations under section 47. This includes the obligation to be a member of AFCA and the obligation to comply with the credit legislation. Section 53(1) of the Credit Act outlines the obligation to lodge an ACC and is defined as credit legislation in section 5 of the Credit Act.</p>
<p>Under section 54(1)(d) of the Credit Act, ASIC may cancel a credit licence if the levies and late payment penalties relating to those levies have not been paid in full within 12 months after the due date for payment.</p>

<title>ASIC Pursues Licensees After Financial Advisers Gave Advice While Unregistered</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-pursues-licensees-after-financial-advisers-gave-advice-while-unregistered-2025717/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-pursues-licensees-after-financial-advisers-gave-advice-while-unregistered-2025717/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC issued infringement notices to two AFS licensees whose financial advisers provided personal advice while unregistered.</p>
<p>Sky Money Pty Ltd and Smart Financial Capital Pty Ltd each paid an infringement notice penalty of $31,300 on 1 July 2025 and 11 July 2025, respectively. Payment of an infringement notice is not an admission of guilt or liability.</p>
<p>ASIC acted because it had reasonable grounds to believe that the AFS licensees had authorised a financial adviser who gave personal advice to a retail client in relation to relevant financial products while the adviser was unregistered.</p>
<p>Failure to register a financial adviser creates a risk for consumers who may receive personal advice from unregistered advisers. The registration requirement is an important consumer protection mechanism to ensure AFS licensees have considered and received declarations about whether their financial advisers are fit and proper and meet the education and training standards.</p>
<p>Each AFS licensee immediately registered their financial adviser and reported the breach to ASIC after becoming aware of their individual being unregistered. ASIC had regard to these circumstances in deciding its approach to taking enforcement action.</p>
<p>A copy of the infringement notices is published on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/online-services/search-asic-registers/other-registers/infringement-notices-register/" title="Infringement notices register">Infringement notices register</a>.</p>
<p>ASIC has now issued five infringement notices this year to AFS licensees who breached their obligations requirements [<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2025-releases/25-053mr-advice-licensees-pay-penalty-for-authorising-advisers-who-gave-advice-while-unregistered/" title="25-053MR Advice licensees pay penalty for authorising advisers who gave advice while unregistered">25-053MR</a>].</p>
<p>It is important AFS licensees maintain ongoing compliance with the registration requirement for financial advisers and take steps to ensure that relevant providers comply.</p>
<p>There are significant consequences for non-compliance with the registration requirement. AFS licensees should be aware of their obligations and communicate with their advisers so that personal advice is not provided while advisers are unregistered.</p>
<h2>Important Reminders</h2>
<p>Financial advisers and their AFS licensees should check the adviser&rsquo;s registration status on the&nbsp;<a href="https://moneysmart.gov.au/financial-advice/financial-advisers-register">Financial advisers register</a>&nbsp;to ensure that it says 'registered' before the adviser gives any personal advice to retail clients.</p>
<p>AFS licensees and relevant providers need to be aware of their ongoing registration obligations, ensuring that they understand when an individual needs to be registered and the circumstances which may lead to a relevant provider being unregistered.</p>
<p>If a financial adviser&rsquo;s authorisation to provide personal advice is ceased by their AFS licensee, an AFS licensee will need to re-register the adviser before the adviser can legally provide personal advice again (see FAQ 21 in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/financial-services/financial-advice/running-a-financial-advice-business/registering-a-relevant-provider-with-asic/registration-for-relevant-providers/" title="Registration for relevant providers">INFO 276</a>&nbsp;Registration for relevant providers).</p>
<p>The law requires that if a financial adviser breaches the law by giving financial advice while unregistered, ASIC must either refer the financial adviser to the Financial Services and Credit Panel or take its own regulatory action.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In this media release, we have used the term &lsquo;financial adviser&rsquo; and &lsquo;relevant provider&rsquo; interchangeably.</p>
<p>The registration requirement has applied since 16 February 2024 and means a relevant provider must be authorised by an AFS licensee to provide personal advice and registered with ASIC before giving financial advice to retail clients. A relevant provider is an individual who is a financial services licensee, an authorised representative, or an employee or director of a financial services licensee who is authorised to provide personal advice to retail clients in relation to relevant financial products. AFS licensees must apply to register a relevant provider with ASIC.</p>
<p>The requirement for relevant providers to be registered was introduced by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2021A00115/latest/text"><em>Financial Sector Reform (Hayne Royal Commission Response&mdash;Better Advice) Act 2021</em></a>&nbsp;(<strong>Better Advice Act</strong>) in response to Recommendation 2.10 of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry. The registration requirement is separate to the pre-existing requirement for an AFS licensee to appoint a relevant provider to the Financial Advisers Register once they have been authorised.</p>
<p>If an authorised financial adviser gives personal advice while unregistered, the adviser breaches s921Y of the Corporations Act and the AFS licensee breaches s921Z of the Corporations Act.</p>
<p>ASIC has published guidance on its website about registering a relevant provider and recorded a webinar to assist AFS licensees.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Thank you, Chairman [Chris] Hayward. You have once again gone out of your way to make me feel welcome in London. Thank you also to all of you who are here today. Before I begin, I must remind you that my views are my own as a Commissioner of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and not necessarily those of the SEC or my fellow Commissioners or of anyone else in U.S. Government.</p>
<p>It is an honor to stand before you in this grand and historic room. The Guildhall is a symbol of resilience&mdash;the site is rich with centuries of history that enliven a vibrant present&mdash;and renewal&mdash;when fire or war has damaged the place, reconstruction followed. Notably, the Guildhall survived London&rsquo;s Great Fire of 1666, though not fully intact.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>&nbsp;Samuel Pepys, the go-to eyewitness of the fire that burned much of London to the ground, described watching &ldquo;the fire grow . . . in a most horrid malicious bloody flame&rdquo; so that it &ldquo;made [him] weep to see it.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>Although the fire&rsquo;s official death toll was remarkably low at six people, the four-day conflagration caused years of immeasurable human suffering for an overwhelmingly homeless, and universally, haunted population.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;Pepys, whose house survived the blaze&mdash;as presumably did the Parmesan cheese he had buried before fleeing the oncoming flames<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a>&mdash;remarked a few days after the fire that he &ldquo;sleeping and waking had a fear of fire in my heart&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;and in 1667 still could not &ldquo;sleep at night without great terrors of fire.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a>&nbsp;Rebuilding began right away but took decades to complete. In December 1667, Pepys observed that &ldquo;the city [had] got a pace on in the rebuilding of Guildhall.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;As with any large-scale reconstruction, conflicting architectural plans, regulatory uncertainty,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;and legal wrangling about how to rebuild and who foots the bill sometimes slowed progress. But, with the help of its financial markets,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a>&nbsp;the city rebuilt itself from the ashes, this time with less flammable materials.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p>London&rsquo;s ability to survive and thrive after the Great Fire served as a precedent for its later perseverance through and recovery from the ravages of World War II bombings of the city. Pepys was not around to document those events, but photographic evidence tells of the destruction and suffering in a way that words could not.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>&nbsp;Photos of the post-air-raid Guildhall reveal a pile of rubble against a still-standing grand backdrop.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Again, London rebuilt the Guildhall and the rest of itself from its bombed ruins into a thriving metropolis. The United States through the Marshall Plan and other measures helped to finance that effort. That assistance, a continuation of the wartime alliance, is evidence of a relationship that runs deep between our nations. Physical manifestations of that connection exist in the damaged London church that was reconstructed as a memorial to Winston Churchill in Missouri<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;and in the bomb detritus that was shipped from the United Kingdom in empty aid ships returning to the United States and used to build parts of New York City.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;The US-UK bond also reveals itself in the intertwining of our markets for human talent, capital, physical goods, and services, including financial services.</p>
<p>Smart financial regulation embraces and perpetuates the knitting together of our two nations. Because we share so many of the same principles, the United Kingdom is a natural partner with the United States in the endeavor to foster resilient and robust global capital markets. We have a long history of working together. We both have common-law systems that afford strong legal protections to investors. We share an appreciation for the role capital markets play in empowering our people to build a vibrant, prosperous society. We both recognize the importance of market-driven capital allocation decisions in ensuring that society builds the right things and builds them well. We both acknowledge the importance of innovation and competition in serving people&rsquo;s needs. Both jurisdictions value an environment in which incumbents and new entrants can try new things and change the way old systems work. Both jurisdictions, by promulgating and implementing generally sensible and properly focused regulatory frameworks, have fostered capital markets that attract global investors and talent.</p>
<p>Shared principles alone are not enough to bind our markets together. Regulatory cooperation, which takes many forms, helps too. I have benefited on this trip, for example, from bilateral meetings with my UK counterparts, and similar meetings happen frequently between UK and US officials. Supervisory colleges bring regulators and supervisors together to compare notes on multinational market participants. Substituted compliance&mdash;a tool we have used in security-based swaps regulation<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a>&mdash;enables a market participant that meets one jurisdiction&rsquo;s regulatory requirements to satisfy the rules of the other jurisdiction geared toward a similar objective. UK and US regulators have worked together to overcome data access challenges to clear the way for US examinations of the more than 270 UK investment advisers serving clients in the US and for additional UK advisers to join their ranks.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;UK and US authorities also routinely cooperate on enforcement matters by, for example, facilitating one another&rsquo;s investigations of potential securities law violations.</p>
<p>Just over a year ago, I suggested another tool for regulators to use in bringing our markets together. In a comment letter to the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority on their consultation on a digital securities sandbox, I suggested a cross-border sandbox.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;The UK government had proposed a digital securities sandbox, which was limited to UK firms, to generate real-world insights about whether distributed ledger technology could streamline the issuance, trading, and settlement of securities without undermining investor protection, market integrity, or financial stability.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>&nbsp;I posited that a cross-border version of the sandbox could be even more effective: innovators could benefit from simultaneously serving UK and US markets; regulators, relying on information sharing agreements, could benefit by seeing more data on how complex emerging technologies operate in different contexts; and the British and American public could benefit by being served by a greater pool of product and service providers.</p>
<p>As I envisioned it, a very flexible US micro-innovation sandbox would pair well with a UK sandbox; participants could adhere to a single set of conditions in both jurisdictions. Details matter, and I ended the letter by welcoming a discussion on how we might bring a cross-border sandbox to life. I have appreciated expressions of interest from the public and private sector in the UK, including much useful feedback gathered by Chairman Hayward and his colleagues at the City of London. Several months ago, referring to my sandbox, Chancellor Reeves advocated &ldquo;explor[ing] opportunities to support industry to innovate cross-border . . . potentially allowing greater digital collaboration between capital markets in New York and London.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>&nbsp;And at last night&rsquo;s Mansion House Speech, Chancellor Reeves reiterated her support for &ldquo;proposals for greater digital collaboration between our two financial centres.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The goal of future conversations between our two jurisdictions should be a financial system better able to serve UK and US investors, innovators, and entrepreneurs. A sandbox can serve as a bridge between our current rulebooks and future financial markets by allowing people to experiment with technology that may underpin the markets of the future.</p>
<p>As I have thought more about the sandbox idea in the past year and talked with others, several themes have emerged. First, perhaps the term &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo; undersells the efficacy of the tool. &ldquo;Sandbox&rdquo; describes a regulatory mechanism that the UK and other jurisdictions have put to productive use.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;Yet the term evokes for some an isolated laboratory environment with no prospect of long-term commercialization and for others children at play. Innovators are childlike only in their healthy sense of curiosity, which enables them to identify and solve societal problems. As I have said before, beaches are better than sandboxes. Beaches give innovators more room to formulate and reformulate ideas within eyeshot of the regulator&mdash;in this analogy the lifeguard&mdash;but lifeguards do not opine every time a beachgoer adds a turret to her sandcastle, as a regulator sitting in a sandbox with the innovator might be tempted to do.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;Despite its appeal to this freedom-lover, &ldquo;cross-border beach&rdquo; is unlikely to catch on as a term. Maybe we can come up with another descriptor such as technology incubator, but meanwhile we are stuck with &ldquo;sandbox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Second, a sandbox has limited utility unless it comes with a smooth exit ramp that takes the participant into a workable permanent regulatory environment. Incorporating an effective exit ramp facilitates commercial experiments that lead to better, cheaper products and services and a more resilient and efficient financial market infrastructure.</p>
<p>Third, and related, a sandbox with time, customer, or activity limits, absent a nimble mechanism to extend the timeline or raise the limits, could put sand in the gears of a growing company or even bring it to a screeching halt. After a period of slow and steady growth, user interest might spike suddenly. If a regulator were not able to react quickly, the company would have to turn new users away, which could color adversely the public&rsquo;s perception of the company. Similarly, regulators must stand ready to work with participants to change conditions as needed. As part of the standard innovation process, a team may start with one idea and pivot in response to market demand.</p>
<p>Fourth, incumbent firms and new entrants should have equal access to the sandbox. Some observers worry that if entry criteria are not transparent, the sandbox could become a mechanism for regulators to pick winners. Everyone should be able to participate on the same terms, but the whole point of a sandbox is to accommodate experimentation with different ways of doing things. Transparent terms available to everyone with an option to iterate may address this concern. In operating a sandbox, regulators also must be cognizant of the cost of participating, which can be prohibitive for small entities or even for large firms if long-term commercialization is not a reality. A proactive invitation to firms of all shapes, ages, and sizes to come in and talk about whether the sandbox is right for them can help not only to combat perceptions of favoritism, but to build trust, and inform regulators of market developments.</p>
<p>Fifth, regulators cannot force participants into a sandbox. A cross-border sandbox only makes sense if it streamlines the road to commercial viability for a company that wants to serve both the UK and the US. Sandbox projects need to be organically generated, not planned by government working groups. As London found out in rebuilding after the 1666 fire and after the wartime firebombing, grand plans drawn up by experts often give way to organic building in response to real and immediate human needs. Operationalization of a sandbox may have to wait until a company with a concrete idea for cross-border activity approaches both regulators, though I look forward to preparatory discussions in the meantime, including joint discussions with firms and both sets of regulators in the same room.</p>
<p>Sixth, the conditions imposed by a cross-border sandbox would need to be workable for both jurisdictions. For example, I would not support conditioning a sandbox on sustainability or diversity objectives. Extracting conditions unrelated to&mdash;and potentially distracting from&mdash;the safe and effective functioning of the project would be an improper use of financial regulation to achieve political outcomes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a></p>
<p>Seventh, although not a new thought, many people have underscored the importance of protecting investors and markets from harm caused by sandbox activities. These objectives align with the SEC&rsquo;s mission, but an often-forgotten part of protecting investors and markets is ensuring that new competitors, products, services, and ways of doing things can come into the market. A sandbox constrains, but does not eliminate, risk, which is consistent with sound regulation. As Chancellor Reeves noted last night, regulation can &ldquo;go too far in seeking to eliminate risk.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Much of my thinking about a potential sandbox has been in connection with crypto. Blockchain technology, given its early stage and potential for transforming the way our financial system and perhaps other systems work, is ripe for experimentation. The SEC&rsquo;s Crypto Task Force has received written comment on the issue of sandboxes.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>&nbsp;The topic of fostering experimentation also comes up in some of the Task Force&rsquo;s meetings with the public.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;Market participants are looking to experiment with bitcoin and other crypto assets, stablecoins, non-fungible tokens, digital identity solutions, collateral management, and tokenization of securities and assets such as real estate, among other issues. Blockchain allows for increased transparency, enhanced efficiency, lower costs, increased liquidity, and decentralization. In recent years, many use cases for the technology likely remained unexplored in the face of regulatory hostility or died in the labyrinth of regulatory ambiguity before they could achieve commercial success. The unique challenges and opportunities raised by blockchain technology and crypto assets and their borderless nature would lend themselves well to a mechanism for facilitating experiments and could help to identify where and how existing regulations might need to change in response. Because market participants are exploring numerous models, a sandbox for tokenizing securities might make sense. Building in cross-border interoperability will be easier now than later when business models have matured. I head back to the US today with the hope that the Crypto Task Force can collaborate with the FCA in coordination with our domestic colleagues across the government and in the context of the Administration&rsquo;s broader cooperation with the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Because I prize the ability of capital to flow to its highest and best use, regardless of borders, and of investors to share in the wealth created by entrepreneurs all over the world, I also hope that our cross-jurisdiction partnership can serve as an example of how more than just our two nations can align interests in pursuit of a freer and more prosperous society. Fundamental differences in approaches to and objectives of financial regulation, however, could impede such efforts. Securities markets are key to solving all manner of problems, but only if market participants are free to respond to market incentives rather than serving as robotic mercenaries in a government-orchestrated initiative to achieve objectives unrelated to investor protection, efficiency, competition and capital formation. As Europe&rsquo;s embrace of double materiality in corporate reporting and export of its sustainability disclosure requirements have laid bare, market integration suffers when two jurisdictions diverge on core matters such as the purpose of financial statements and other securities disclosures.</p>
<p>On a related note that may be relevant to some people in the room, the SEC recently asked for comment on the definition of a Foreign Private Issuer (&ldquo;FPI&rdquo;), which provides a number of specific accommodations from which eligible FPIs may currently benefit as compared to domestic issuers.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>&nbsp;One of the few comments to date came from an FPI based in the UK urging us &ldquo;to consider carve-outs or refined eligibility criteria that preserve FPI status for companies with genuine foreign governance and infrastructure, regardless of shareholder geography or incorporation jurisdiction.&rdquo;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-old-flames-071625#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>&nbsp;That first-hand perspective is valuable, and I look forward to hearing from other interested members of the public, including UK companies, on this topic with similar or differing views.</p>
<p>Thank you for indulging me today with your attention. I hope that the coming months will bring continuing discussions about how people from our two countries can work together for our mutual prosperity and benefit. Cross-border cooperation, whether in the context of crypto or capital markets, is a good way to fan the flames of our long friendship.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;I am here to discuss one of the most important resources that policymakers have: the lessons of history. In discharging my responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, I have been thinking a lot about history. Its study provides the opportunity to step out of the particular circumstances of today to inform our understanding of the core issues at the heart of financial regulation. While we must be attentive to new and even unprecedented challenges, experience shows that understanding the lessons of history gives policymakers a great advantage. Many of the decisions we face today have, in some form, been confronted by previous generations of policymakers.</p>
<p>In these remarks, I want to discuss a particular pattern in the history of the financial system, which is the relationship between regulatory weakening and the economic and financial cycle of booms and busts. My intent is not to re-hash well-examined facts or to go over past historical episodes chapter and verse. Rather, I aim to offer a perspective on this historical throughline that focuses on the regulatory cycle.</p>
<p>It's widely accepted that the economy and financial system experience cyclical booms and busts. Booms have historically been characterized by a multitude of good things. These can include fast economic growth, workers who had been sidelined entering the workforce and improving their lives, and financial innovations that often make credit or investments more readily available. At the same time, some of the characteristics of a boom economy, such as rapid increases in credit and in financial market activity, as well as greater risk-taking and leverage, can sow the seeds of busts. In busts, economic activity and lending contract and asset prices decline. This can lead to rapid deleveraging and dislocation throughout the financial system, which worsen the downturn, causing job losses and business closures, homes lost and lives upended.</p>
<p>There are usually multiple causes that drive booms and make busts so terrible, some unique to each individual episode. But one factor that is common to many past cycles of boom and bust is weakening financial regulation. Weakening regulation often drives risk-taking and increases bank fragility during the boom, making the ensuing bust more painful. Indeed, economic research suggests that weaker regulation leads to more bank failures, setting the stage for worse recessions.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;Moreover, because the financial system evolves so rapidly, regulation must also continuously adjust. Much regulatory weakening occurs simply when regulators fail to keep pace, while at other times, there is a deliberate action to lower regulatory burden that ends up miscalculating the risk involved. Let me be clear here that, when I refer to regulatory weakening, I mean not only direct deregulatory actions by regulators or legislators, but also failure of the regulatory framework to keep up with changing circumstances.</p>
<p>In principle, financial regulation should incentivize banks to engage in responsible risk-taking and build up resources in good times, so that they can deal with times of financial stress and continue their vital role in the economy in bad times. The prosperity that accompanies a healthy economy should allow banks to invest in improved risk management and strong financial resources. However, a healthy economy can also reduce the effectiveness of regulatory constraints on bank risk-taking. This can occur for a host of reasons, including behavioral biases, political pressure, market dynamics, and the tendency for innovation to move more quickly than regulators. These dynamics can result in regulatory weakening during boom times. When actively pursued, this weakening often appears justified at the time and may be implemented by well-meaning policymakers who simply miscalculate the long-run effects of their actions.</p>
<p>My purpose in these remarks is to recount several boom-and-bust episodes in American history and identify some lessons that can guide policymakers entrusted with the responsibility of promoting a strong and stable banking system. This history demonstrates the connection between regulatory weakening and cycles of boom and bust. I don't mean to suggest that more regulation is always better or that repealing and reforming regulations isn't sometimes appropriate to remove obsolete rules and relieve unnecessary burden. But, if we can at least agree that regulation should seek to limit devastating financial crises, then the history that I will describe today offers some lessons for anyone thinking about regulatory policy.</p>
<p>There are, of course, lots of examples to choose from, both in the United States and abroad, but I'll focus on the Great Depression, the Savings and Loan (S&amp;L) crisis, and the Global Financial Crisis. I will then discuss some possible reasons that similar episodes could recur and conclude with some thoughts on the lessons we can learn.</p>
<p><span>The Great Depression</span><br />Let's start with the biggest and most widely studied bust in U.S. history, the Great Depression. Scholars continue to debate its causes, which were multiple and complex. One compelling argument focuses on the failure of regulation to keep pace with the innovations of the Roaring Twenties. As I said, I view such regulatory stagnation as a form of weakening. This weakened regulatory environment played a role in setting the stage for and then exacerbating the bust. Weakened regulation that had failed to keep up with the times left banks unable to weather shocks to the economy. The banking sector's collapse was a significant factor in making the Great Depression the most severe economic crisis that this country has ever experienced.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p>The Roaring Twenties expansion was powered by the post-war recovery and technological advances in transportation, manufacturing, and communications. Stock markets grew quickly to help finance this innovation, while residential and commercial real estate investment surged and swelling demand for consumer durables led in turn to increased demand for financing.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;As credit needs escalated, there was intensifying competition among banks; savings and loan institutions (S&amp;Ls); and rapidly growing nonbank finance companies, trust companies, and other financial vehicles.</p>
<p>The 1920s were also characterized by high levels of financial speculation, both inside and outside the banking sector. Banks engaged in speculation through nonbank affiliates and supported speculation by lending. At the same time, many banks were relatively thinly capitalized and overly concentrated, especially given the lack of federal deposit insurance at the time. In addition, many states had prohibitions on branching that prevented banks from diversifying their portfolios and inhibited local competition, keeping many struggling banks alive.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;The stock market boomed, margin lending grew dramatically, and insider trading and market manipulation were rampant.</p>
<p>As the financialization of the economy increased, the regulatory framework failed to keep up. Outdated branching restrictions remained, failing to reflect the size and dynamism of the modern economy. Banks gained permission to engage in new activities, such as real estate lending and certain activities in the securities markets; however, capital requirements and other rules were not adjusted to reflect potential increased risks from these new activities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;The cumulative effect of these events was a significantly weakened regulatory environment and a substantial buildup in risk, without a commensurate increase in resources to allow the sector to withstand the risks posed.</p>
<p>Looking back, we know that, when the economic shock hit, the banking system magnified that shock. The boom of the Roaring Twenties started to go bust in 1929, when the fast growth of the past decade turned to contraction, followed by a series of financial and banking crises. In all, approximately 9,000 of the nation's 23,000 banks failed, resulting in major losses to depositors, given the lack of federal deposit insurance, and a significant contraction in credit that deepened and lengthened the economic downturn.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Notably, banks in states that had more robust regulatory frameworks&mdash;for example, those that applied higher capital requirements&mdash;had lower rates of failure.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn8" title="footnote 8"><span>8</span></a><a name="f8"></a></p>
<p>In response to the financial collapse in the Great Depression, Congress adopted reforms aimed at addressing risks that had driven those panics. Among these steps, Congress established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and federal deposit insurance to reduce the risk of bank runs and protect retail depositors. Congress increased regulatory oversight of banks and separated commercial and investment banking. Congress also enacted strong securities laws and created the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Overall, these steps helped stabilize the financial sector and ushered in a long period of quiescence in banking.</p>
<p><span>The Savings &amp; Loan Crisis</span><br />My second example today is the S&amp;L crisis of the 1980s and early 1990s, which did substantial harm to millions of Americans and the financial system and was extremely expensive to resolve. In this episode, in contrast to the Great Depression, affirmative deregulation led to excessive risk-taking by S&amp;Ls, as well as banks, during a boom period. As circumstances soured, revealing weaknesses, Congress attempted to bolster the S&amp;L sector by loosening the regulatory framework further. This failed to resolve the underlying stress and instead further fueled the buildup in risk-taking, worsening the losses in the subsequent bust.</p>
<p>Let me first set the stage. The years leading up to the S&amp;L crisis were characterized by dramatic growth in business credit, in the course of the economic expansion that began in 1982. At the beginning of this period, the S&amp;L sector primarily served the residential real estate market because of restrictions on S&amp;L activities. These restrictions eased over the 1980s, allowing S&amp;Ls to get significantly larger and engage in new kinds of lending; however, these changes were not accompanied by sufficient regulatory enhancements to account for increased risks. This expansion in S&amp;L activity also presented new competition with commercial banks, which had themselves built up significant risks as they expanded into new activities.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn9" title="footnote 9"><span>9</span></a><a name="f9"></a></p>
<p>At the same time, both S&amp;Ls and banks were increasingly under pressure due to both high inflation and high interest rates, which disrupted their funding models.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn10" title="footnote 10"><span>10</span></a><a name="f10"></a>&nbsp;Competition for customer funds increased dramatically, especially because of the rise of money market mutual funds, which had grown rapidly. When Congress removed outdated deposit rate caps to allow banks and S&amp;Ls to more effectively compete for funds, it did so without implementing adequate safeguards against these institutions taking on excessive risk. This led many S&amp;Ls to engage in increasingly risky projects to compensate for escalating funding costs. Banks also increased their deposit rates and took on more risk.</p>
<p>As vulnerabilities at S&amp;Ls became evident, Congress, federal regulators, and the states attempted to bolster both sectors with the hope of allowing them to outgrow those weaknesses. For instance, Congress and the states reduced restrictions on S&amp;Ls' ability to invest in commercial and consumer loans.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn11" title="footnote 11"><span>11</span></a><a name="f11"></a>&nbsp;These changes contributed to the boom in commercial real estate lending, which became a key source of vulnerability. In addition, Congress and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the federal S&amp;L regulator at the time, weakened capital requirements and the enforcement of those requirements for the S&amp;L sector.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn12" title="footnote 12"><span>12</span></a><a name="f12"></a>&nbsp;This allowed institutions to become weaker and poorly capitalized entities to stay afloat, leaving S&amp;Ls as a whole badly positioned to weather adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The bust, when it came, was severe. S&amp;L losses continued to mount throughout the 1980s. Many banks also experienced severe stress. These difficulties were amplified by an eventual decline in real estate values and problems in the agricultural and energy sectors. In 1980, there were just under 4,000 S&amp;Ls. By 1989, that number had fallen to below 3,000, with over 500 of the remaining institutions insolvent as judged by book value. And over 1,600 banks failed between 1980 and 1994. Regulatory weakening had propped up tottering institutions, allowing zombie institutions to persist, accumulating much greater losses than they otherwise would have. The process of cleaning up the sector began in earnest in the late 1980s and continued into the mid-1990s, with a final cost of $160 billion, roughly 5 percent of gross domestic product at the time.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn13" title="footnote 13"><span>13</span></a><a name="f13"></a>&nbsp;And the cost of resolving insured banks that failed during this period was $36 billion.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn14" title="footnote 14"><span>14</span></a><a name="f14"></a></p>
<p>Congress implemented significant reforms in response to the S&amp;L crisis, including stricter capital and accounting requirements, limits on insured depository institutions' investment powers, and expansions of regulators' enforcement authority. These changes paved the way for stability in the banking sector for some time.</p>
<p><span>The Global Financial Crisis</span><br />I'll turn now to my final example, the Global Financial Crisis, which had devastating effects for the millions of people who lost their livelihoods, their homes, and their businesses.</p>
<p>In the decade leading up to the crisis, America experienced rapid credit growth and a housing boom. There was optimism about the benefits of financial innovation, such as securitization of home loans, and belief in the power of market discipline as a form of self-regulation. Home prices and mortgage debt accelerated in tandem, driven by a mutually reinforcing cycle of optimism, with home prices roughly doubling between 1997 and 2006, and even larger increases in mortgage debt.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn15" title="footnote 15"><span>15</span></a><a name="f15"></a>&nbsp;Amid this boom, lending standards dropped, driven by investor demand for mortgage-backed securities, which were increasingly opaque and risky in their design but still highly rated by the rating agencies. There was substantial growth in the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market, including new forms of credit derivatives. Money market funds boomed, becoming increasingly linked to the off-balance sheet business of banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn16" title="footnote 16"><span>16</span></a><a name="f16"></a>&nbsp;These developments led to the emergence of large, short-funded, and interconnected financial entities&mdash;both banks and nonbanks.</p>
<p>The regulatory environment failed to keep up with these changes in activity and the increasing complexity of financial institutions and markets, and regulatory weakening heightened vulnerabilities. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, enacted in 1999, permitted the creation of financial holding companies that could engage in the full range of financial activities; however, the act did not put in place a regulatory framework commensurate with the full range of financial risks and permitted nonbank firms such as investment banks and insurance conglomerates to compete with banks wholly outside its framework. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 exempted OTC derivatives transactions from virtually all regulation and oversight by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and SEC.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the crisis, regulators cut oversight further. A striking image from the time featured the head of one financial regulatory agency wielding a chainsaw to demonstrate his commitment to slashing regulations.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250716a.htm#fn17" title="footnote 17"><span>17</span></a><a name="f17"></a>&nbsp;The competitive landscape and regulatory lacuna led to a race to the bottom in standards for underwriting and issuing mortgage loans and securities, and transactions became increasingly funded by opaque and unstable short-term wholesale funding. Consumers were left unprotected as the subprime crisis grew. In addition, the largest investment banks, which were overseen by the SEC, increased their leverage with heavy reliance on short-term funding, leaving them increasingly vulnerable to any losses. These are just a few examples of the widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision that occurred in both the banking and nonbanking sectors in the lead-up to the crisis.</p>
<p>The resulting recession and financial crisis saw the deepest and longest contraction in economic activity since the second world war, the collapse of large financial institutions, significant government support to keep the financial system afloat, and a prolonged period of slow growth.</p>
<p>In response to this crisis, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, a reform package that, among other things, strengthened bank capital, addressed off-balance sheet exposures, and provided for stress testing. Consumer protections were strengthened, and a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was established. Supervisors ramped up forward-looking supervision. In addition, banking regulators adopted capital and liquidity reforms, which substantially improved the resiliency of the banking sector. Studying the role that regulatory weakening played in the crisis provides a powerful reminder of the importance of preserving these regulatory gains.</p>
<p><span>Lessons for Policymakers</span><br />Reviewing these three examples together, it is striking to see the pattern of regulatory weakening during a boom, including the failure of the regulatory environment to keep pace with the evolving financial sector, and how this weakening lays the foundation for a subsequent bust. Why do we continue to see these cycles?</p>
<p>Some reasons are psychological, others political. Humans have short memories, especially for experiences we might like to forget. The further we get from a crisis, the more its causes fade from memory and the less likely a recurrence seems. We become more likely to view regulations as unduly burdensome and place less value on the protection they offer from downside risk. The financial sector itself lobbies hard to weaken regulation, which is often effective when the last crisis seems far away.</p>
<p>Credit cycles, financial innovation, and the evolving needs of the economy are also significant contributors. As the economy changes, so do financing needs. This makes it harder to recognize when things are running too hot. In addition, regulators are understandably cautious about restraining innovations that have societal benefits, which may hinder their ability to reduce associated risks. Longstanding regulations can be subject to regulatory arbitrage, making them less effective as activities migrate outside the regulated system. These dynamics make the financial sector unstable, feeding the boom-and-bust cycle.</p>
<p>How can we do better?</p>
<p>The first lesson is to approach the financial system with a through-the-cycle perspective and avoid thinking "this time is different." In each of the booms I have covered, there was a heady confidence that market discipline would control risk-taking, that downside risks were so implausible as not to merit attention, and that easing regulation was justified. With such confidence, insufficient thought was given to how regulatory weakening might create new vulnerabilities. A bit of humility would have helped. While it is true that regulation must evolve with the economy and financial system, we need to recognize that relaxing rules can create vulnerabilities. Changes in the markets themselves can also weaken the effectiveness of regulations.</p>
<p>The second lesson is that policymakers should resist the pressure to loosen regulations or to refrain from imposing regulation on new activities during the boom times. With past economic downturns in the rearview mirror, regulations start to be seen as a limitation on growth, rather than necessary protection against vulnerabilities. As became evident in past episodes, vigilant supervision and prudent rules on risk-taking are important to prevent future crises. While there is a tradeoff, it is important to have appropriate protections in place to reduce the risks and costs of the resulting busts.</p>
<p>Third, regulation cannot be static. If regulation fails to keep up with evolution of the financial sector, it can create new risks or hinder growth.</p>
<p>To conclude, an important lesson we can draw from U.S. financial crises is the role that ill-advised weakening of the bank regulatory framework played in those crises. It is well within our ability, and is our duty as regulators, to learn from these episodes to avoid making the same mistakes. In doing so, we can help to ensure that the financial system is prepared to weather downturns and continue to serve households and businesses.</p>

<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. National banks received authorization to engage in branching, subject to state law, in 1927 but interstate branching remained prohibited.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. Before 1900, national banks were prohibited from underwriting, dealing, or investing in securities. However, federal authorities loosened these restrictions by allowing national banks to establish bond departments that could underwrite, sell, and invest in debt securities. Although restrictions on dealing in stock remained, national banks were able to circumvent these restrictions by organizing affiliates that engaged in the full range of activities with regard to both stocks and bonds. Federal regulatory authorities did not interfere with these affiliate activities. Scholars continue to debate the extent to which this underwriting activity was risky for the banks. See Wilmarth Jr., "Does Financial Liberalization Increase the Likelihood of a Systemic Banking Crisis?" (see note 4); and Eugene Nelson White (1986), "Before the Glass-Steagall Act: An Analysis of the Investment Banking Activities of National Banks,"&nbsp;<em>Explorations in Economic History</em>, vol. 23 (1), pp. 33&ndash;55.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a name="fn9"></a>9. Federal regulators, as well as many state legislatures and state banking authorities, expanded the scope of permissible activities for banks during this period.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn10"></a>10. For example, S&amp;Ls made long-term, fixed rate residential mortgage loans, funded with short-term retail liabilities. As rates increased, S&amp;Ls' existing mortgage portfolios decreased in value, because of their fixed rates. At the same time, S&amp;Ls were forced to pay higher rates on their liabilities. This situation threatened their continued viability.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn11"></a>11. Many states simultaneously relaxed their own activities restrictions for state charters to allow for real estate investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn12"></a>12. For instance, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reduced net worth requirements for federally insured S&amp;Ls to allow troubled S&amp;Ls to avoid closure and hopefully recover once interest rates declined.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn13"></a>13. This figure refers to the cost of resolving S&amp;Ls that failed during the crisis. See Alane Moysich (1997), "<a href="https://www.fdic.gov/resources/publications/history-eighties/volume-1/history-80s-volume-1-part1-04.pdf">The Savings and Loan Crisis and Its Relationship to Banking (PDF)</a>," in&nbsp;<em>History of the Eighties--Lessons for the Future,</em>&nbsp;vol. 1:&nbsp;<em>An Examination of the Banking Crises of the 1980s and Early 1990s</em>&nbsp;(Washington: Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation), pp. 167&ndash;88; and U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2025),&nbsp;<a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/GDP">Gross Domestic Product</a>, via FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, June 26 (accessed July 15, 2025, 1982:Q4 used as gross domestic product reference point).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn14"></a>14. This figure reflects costs associated with bank failures from 1980 through 1994.</p>
<p><a name="fn15"></a>15.

<p><a name="fn16"></a>16. For example, many banks created asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) programs as conduits that allowed them to fund bank assets without bringing them on balance sheet, thereby avoiding regulatory capital treatment. However, this approach created significant risks because the primary holders of ABCP were money market mutual funds, which are ultra-sensitive to payment delays and themselves subject to run risk. Money market funds also similarly funded other parts of banks' balance sheets in the lead-up to the crisis. In addition, other private cash-like instruments, such as auction rate securities, repurchase agreements based on ABCP, and other short-term debt instruments that were treated like money created new vulnerabilities as they grew and subsequently collapsed.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Federal bank regulatory agencies today jointly issued a proposal to rescind the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) final rule issued in October 2023 and replace it with the prior CRA regulations that were originally adopted by the agencies in 1995, with certain technical amendments. If adopted, the proposal would restore certainty in the CRA framework for stakeholders in light of pending litigation and limit regulatory burden on banks, while ensuring that banks continue to serve their communities.</p>
<p>Because the 2023 final rule is subject to legal action and has not taken effect, the agencies continue to apply the 1995 regulations to banks today.</p>
<p>Comments on the attached proposal are due 30 days after date of publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<title>FINRA Foundation Releases Sixth Wave Of The National Financial Capability Study - Findings Reveal Decline In U.S. Adults’ Ability To Make Ends Meet And Save For Emergencies, More Households Strained By Increased Costs, And The Struggle Of The Middle-Income Group - Also, 20% Of U.S. Adults Interested In Getting Financial Advice From Artificial Intelligence</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The FINRA Investor Education Foundation (FINRA Foundation) released today its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/2025-07/NFCS-Report-Sixth-Edition-July-2025.pdf" target="_blank">sixth wave of the National Financial Capability Study</a>, an expansive source of data and insights about the financial lives of U.S. adults that has been conducted every three years since 2009.</p>
<p>Following a 12-year period of sustained improvements in many of the key areas of financial capability included in the National Financial Capability Study&mdash;from the Great Recession of 2009 through the COVID-19 pandemic&mdash;the latest findings reveal an overall pattern of decline in U.S. adults&rsquo; ability to make ends meet and save for emergencies. While the comprehensive study shows no signs of overall declines in income, the findings show that increased costs have put more households under strain than in previous waves of the study.</p>
<p>The findings also indicate what can be described as a &ldquo;struggle of the middle.&rdquo; In many of the demographic breakdowns on measures of financial capability, the middle groups (those with annual household incomes between $25,000 and $75,000, those with some college education but no degree, and those between the ages of 35 and 54) appear to share many of the struggles of those in lower income households, without any college experience and younger cohorts. This is especially apparent in measures of difficulty making ends meet, the impact of higher food costs, setting aside emergency funds and engaging in expensive credit card practices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 2024 National Financial Capability Study reveals a concerning shift in Americans' financial resilience. After more than a decade of improvements, we're seeing many households&mdash;particularly in middle-income brackets&mdash;struggling financially despite stable incomes. This 'struggle of the middle' signals that rising costs are creating financial strain across a broader segment of the population,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/executives/gerri-walsh">Gerri Walsh, President of the FINRA Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The FINRA Foundation&rsquo;s National Financial Capability Study serves as an important barometer of Americans' financial health. By tracking trends over time and exploring the nuances of financial behaviors and attitudes, this study identifies areas where more support and education can create positive impact,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.finra.org/about/governance/executives#econ">Jonathan Sokobin, FINRA Foundation Board Chair and Chief Economist at FINRA</a>. &ldquo;This study is a vital resource that policymakers, researchers, educators, firms and financial professionals can use to better understand and address the financial capability needs of Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>The National Financial Capability Study focuses on four components of financial capability:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Making Ends Meet.</strong>&nbsp;In contrast to the generally positive trends seen from 2009 through 2021, the 2024 data show substantial declines in many of the key measures of making ends meet. More U.S. adults report that they are spending more than their income, and fewer say they are satisfied with their overall financial condition. Two-thirds say that increased food costs have caused them to cut back on other spending. The sub-topics covered include: 
<ul>
<li>Covering expenses</li>
<li>Feelings about personal financial condition</li>
<li>Financial fragility</li>
<li>Income shocks and income volatility</li>
<li>Informal work activities</li>
<li>Intergenerational wealth transfer</li>
<li>Behavioral signs of financial stress</li>
<li>Medical expenses</li>
<li>Effects of inflation</li>
<li>Severe weather and finances</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Planning Ahead.</strong>&nbsp;The percentage of U.S. adults who say they have set aside enough money to cover three months&rsquo; worth of living expenses in case of an emergency dropped to 46 percent from 53 percent in 2021. The percentage saving for retirement varies greatly by education level: 80 percent of college graduates have a retirement account, in contrast to 37 percent of those with no college experience. In response to a new question, 20 percent of adults say they would be interested in getting financial advice from artificial intelligence. The sub-topics covered include: 
<ul>
<li>Rainy day funds</li>
<li>Planning for retirement</li>
<li>Saving for college</li>
<li>Investing</li>
<li>Risk preferences</li>
<li>Financial self-efficacy</li>
<li>Personal finance technology</li>
<li>Artificial intelligence</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Managing Financial Products.</strong>&nbsp;Eighty-one percent of U.S. adults use their mobile devices to access their checking or savings accounts, and over half use mobile devices to make in-person purchases (53 percent) and to transfer money to other people (65 percent). The percentage of respondents saying they always pay their credit cards in full each month (53 percent) has decreased by six percentage points relative to 2021, ending the steady increase seen over the previous five waves of the National Financial Capability Study. Twenty-three percent say they have used Buy Now Pay Later services in the last 12 months. The sub-topics covered include: 
<ul>
<li>Banking and payment methods</li>
<li>Home ownership and mortgages</li>
<li>Credit cards</li>
<li>Student loans</li>
<li>Non-bank borrowing</li>
<li>Buy Now, Pay Later</li>
<li>Overall debt</li>
<li>Credit scores</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Financial Knowledge.</strong>&nbsp;The percentage of respondents correctly answering at least four of five financial knowledge quiz questions has held steady since 2021. Men are more likely than women to answer the quiz questions correctly, though the gap appears to be closing with successive generations. The proportion of respondents who answer the inflation question correctly has increased by five percentage points relative to 2021, with the performance of those aged 18 to 34 improving by ten percentage points. The sub-topics covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial literacy</li>
<li>Self-perceptions of financial knowledge and ability</li>
<li>Financial education</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>NOTE: The FINRA Foundation will hold a virtual press conference about the sixth wave of the National Financial Capability Study at 11 a.m. E.T. today. Unauthorized use of the press conference video or audio is not allowed.</strong></p>

<p><strong>About the National Financial Capability Study</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation launched the first national study of financial capability of adults in the United States. Since its start, the National Financial Capability Study has provided data on multiple indicators of capability&mdash;including financial behaviors, attitudes and knowledge.</p>
<p>National Financial Capability Study survey data is collected every three years. The 2024 survey, conducted from June through October, represents the sixth wave of data. Each wave of the study has data from more than 25,500 U.S. adults across all 50 states and Washington D.C. (500 per state/D.C.), and findings can be reported at both the state and national level. The sixth wave has been updated to include new questions on timely topics, including inflation, artificial intelligence and Buy Now, Pay Later, borrowing, among other topics. This extensive body of data is available for free to the public and researchers.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ISDA has launched the ISDA Notices Hub and the ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol, giving users a faster and more efficient method for delivering critical notices and reducing the uncertainty and risk of losses that can result from delays.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub is a secure online platform provided by S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence that enables fast delivery and receipt of termination notices and waivers and ensures address details for physical delivery are updated centrally. The platform is free for buy-side firms and dealers benefit from a discounted rate for the first two years of operation.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/">ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol</a>&nbsp;enables firms to efficiently update their documentation with other adhering parties to allow the ISDA Notices Hub to be used. As of launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/protocol/isda-2025-notices-hub-protocol/adhering-parties">79 entities from North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific</a>&nbsp;have adhered to the protocol, including dealers, asset managers, pension funds and insurance companies. The protocol is free for all market participants.</p>
<p>Under the ISDA Master Agreement, time-critical termination notices must be delivered by certain prescribed methods including physical delivery, using company address details listed in the agreement. However, delays can occur if a company has moved and the documentation hasn&rsquo;t been updated, or if delivery is not possible due to a pandemic or geopolitical shock. Hold-ups and uncertainty over the delivery of notices can lead to losses running to millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The ISDA Notices Hub reduces these problems by enabling firms to deliver notices quickly and efficiently via a secure online platform. In response to member demand, waivers can also be exchanged, including those for net asset threshold events. Automatic notifications are sent to designated people at the receiving entity who can access the ISDA Notices Hub from anywhere in the world, even if an office is closed. The ISDA 2025 Notices Hub Protocol also requires market participants to update their address details in all their agreements, which can be achieved using the platform via a single entry, creating an up-to-date golden source.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a counterparty fails, the last thing anyone needs is to experience problems delivering the termination notices necessary to close out and value affected trades. By adopting the ISDA Notices Hub, market participants will ensure these notices are sent instantly and securely, reducing risk and minimizing the losses that can result from delays,&rdquo; said Scott O&rsquo;Malia, ISDA&rsquo;s Chief Executive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence is proud to collaborate with ISDA to launch the ISDA Notices Hub, a pioneering platform that transforms the delivery of critical notices in the derivatives market. This secure, user-friendly solution accelerates the exchange of time-sensitive notices, reducing financial risks associated with delays and enhancing market efficiency,&rdquo; said Brittany Garland, Head of Regulatory &amp; Compliance Solutions, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>More information about the ISDA Notices Hub is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.isda.org/isda-solutions-infohub/isda-notices-hub/">here</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>ECB making progress on digital euro rulebook with feedback from experts, consumers and merchants</li>
<li>Around 70 market participants explore use cases through new innovation platform</li>
<li>ECB continues stakeholder engagement to ensure alignment with market needs and legislative developments</li>
</ul>
<p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has published its&nbsp;third progress report&nbsp;on the preparation phase of a digital euro, which was launched on 1 November 2023 and is laying the foundations for the potential issuance of a digital euro.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/euro/digital_euro/progress/html/ecb.deprp202412.en.html">second progress report</a>, the ECB has continued to make progress on the draft digital euro scheme rulebook, which aims to harmonise digital euro payments across the euro area and ensure a modern, user-friendly experience. Extensive feedback from the Rulebook Development Group &ndash; comprising representatives from the European retail payments market &ndash; has helped improve rulebook sections, as have insights from dedicated ECB workstreams featuring around 50 market participants (representing over 30 organisations) and sessions with industry experts on specific topics such as risk management and dispute management.</p>
<p>At the same time, the ECB has intensified experimentation and user research to ensure that the digital euro meets the needs of end users. Through the recently launched&nbsp;<a class="link-inline arrow" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.pr250505~00207689f9.en.html">innovation platform</a>, around 70 market participants have conducted technical tests of features such as conditional payments and explored conceptual ideas and use cases for integrating the digital euro into the financial ecosystem. In parallel, the ECB has engaged directly with small merchants, vulnerable consumers and under-represented groups through focus groups, interviews and collaborations with consumer associations. The main objective of this research is to understand the needs, preferences and challenges of diverse user groups to ensure the digital euro&rsquo;s design is as inclusive and accessible as possible. Findings will be published in the third quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Continuous engagement with stakeholders remains a cornerstone of the digital euro project. The ECB has intensified its outreach to market participants, merchants and consumers through technical sessions, workshops and bilateral meetings. Particular attention has been given to how the digital euro would fit into the existing European payments ecosystem, to ensure that it complements private sector solutions. As the debate on the legislation progresses, the ECB has continued to provide technical expertise to the European institutions involved and project updates to the euro area finance ministers (through the Eurogroup) and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are pleased to see that our efforts remain on track as we keep working to deliver on the&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/ce3fkikz/20250320-euro-summit-statement-en.pdf">request of EU leaders</a>&nbsp;to accelerate progress on a digital euro,&rdquo; said Executive Board member Piero Cipollone, who chairs the High-Level Task Force on a digital euro. &ldquo;In light of today&rsquo;s geopolitical and economic challenges, we welcome an ambitious pace for the legislative work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The digital euro project is a collaborative effort between the ECB, national central banks, market participants, consumer representatives and policymakers. The ECB is committed to providing technical input to support legislative deliberations, and to ensuring that the digital euro meets the highest standards of quality, security, privacy and usability.</p>

<title>EBA Publishes Handbook On Simulation Exercises For Resolution Authorities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-handbook-on-simulation-exercises-for-resolution-authorities-2025716/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eba-publishes-handbook-on-simulation-exercises-for-resolution-authorities-2025716/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>​The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published the latest chapter of its resolution Handbook on simulation exercises for resolution authorities. The Handbook provides, for the first time, a comprehensive framework of best practices, methodologies and processes to support resolution authorities in enhancing their preparedness and operational capabilities through structured simulation exercises.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>​Testing requirements are already imposed to institutions through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/press-releases/eba-published-its-final-resolvability-testing-guidelines" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">EBA Guidelines on resolvability testing</a>, and simulations are becoming more prevalent in ensuring preparation among authorities, the EBA&rsquo;s Handbook proposes a taxonomy for simulation exercises for resolution authorities to harmonise the use of main concepts within the financial stability framework.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​In addition, the Handbook distinguishes between testing, simulations and dry runs and introduces six main types of simulation exercise: brainstorms, desktop exercises, walkthroughs, fire drills, decision-making exercises and operational simulations. This new chapter also presents the concept of end-to-end simulations, which combine multiple exercise types to replicate real-world resolution scenarios.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​The Handbook describes in operational terms how to initiate, plan, prepare and deliver a simulation exercise. It provides practical guidance on defining objectives and scope, designing scenarios, allocating resources, managing delivery, and collecting feedback. The Handbook also includes templates and examples to support authorities in implementing effective and proportionate simulation exercises.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>​Legal basis and background&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>​This initiative is part of the EBA&rsquo;s broader mandate under Article 8(1)(ab) of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 to maintain an up-to-date Union resolution handbook. The Handbook draws on the experience of resolution authorities across the EU and aims to foster convergence, interoperability and cross-border cooperation.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​Simulation exercises are a key tool for resolution authorities to test and refine their internal procedures, decision-making processes and coordination mechanisms as well as to train their staff.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>​The Handbook is available on the EBA&rsquo;s website and is intended for use by all resolution authorities in the EU. It complements the EBA&rsquo;s existing Guidalines on resolvability testing and supports the ongoing development of a robust and credible resolution framework.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Speech</h2>
<p>Good afternoon, thank you for the opportunity to speak today.</p>
<p>Last week we published our latest Financial Stability Report, which provides the FPC&rsquo;s view on the outlook for the UK financial system, in terms of the current conjuncture as well as several structural matters. Today I&rsquo;d like to take a further step back and talk about some long-term trends that will affect the future funding and liquidity environment, and how we policymakers are thinking about liquidity flows across the financial system as it evolves.</p>
<h3>Liquidity flows support the provision of vital services in an evolving landscape</h3>
<p>The Bank&rsquo;s approach to financial stability focusses on the role the financial system plays in providing vital services to households and businesses.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;And in particular its ability to do so in both good and bad times, as disruptions to these services have large and persistent economic costs. For this to happen requires liquidity to flow to where it is needed most across the financial system so that financial institutions have the funding they need to operate effectively.</p>
<p>When we think about that, we need to consider how the provision of financial services to the real economy has been changing over time. In particular, we need to take into account the growing importance of non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) which now play a more significant role than in the past. NBFIs account for around half of assets in the financial system, both globally and in the UK.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>&nbsp;In the UK, market-based finance has accounted for essentially all of the growth in UK corporate credit since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and now accounts for 50% of the stock of corporate lending.</p>
<p>NBFIs play a key role in the provision of a range of financial services to households and businesses, operating both alongside, and in partnership with, banks. They provide services directly, such as financing, insurance, hedging products, and long-term savings. And they also support other direct providers of financial services, for example, by lending to banks in wholesale funding markets. Their activities provide liquidity and depth in the gilt market which serves as the risk-free benchmark for a wide range of sterling-denominated debt, such as corporate bonds. NBFIs also play an important role in the SONIA interest rate swaps market, which is used by banks to hedge their interest rate risk and has a big influence on the pricing of fixed-rate mortgages.</p>
<p>This has brought many positives, including cheaper and more diverse financial services to the real economy. But it has also come with the emergence of new types of risks emanating from the NBFI sector and therefore made it increasingly important to consider the liquidity needs of NBFIs &ndash; whereas traditionally the focus has been on the liquidity needs of banks. We also have to consider the resilience of the channels through which NBFIs access that liquidity.</p>
<p>Risks in the financial system have transformed in other ways which pose different liquidity challenges. Derivatives markets allow financial institutions to hedge their risks, thereby indirectly supporting the provision of financial services. Post-GFC efforts to strengthen the role of central clearing and improve bilateral margining practices have been successful at reducing counterparty risk in the trading of derivatives. However, these changes have also increased liquidity risks arising from margin calls in times of stress, and more of this risk now sits with NBFIs &ndash; something we have talked about before.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>Similarly, repo markets are used by financial institutions, including NBFIs, to manage their day-to-day liquidity and collateral needs, as well as to obtain the funding they need to invest in financial assets, thus supporting the real economy. They allow financial institutions to lend to one another essentially as collateralised loans, reducing counterparty risk. However, repo borrowers are exposed to liquidity risk as they may have to top up the collateral backing their repo loans if the value of that collateral falls sharply in stress. And we&rsquo;ve talked in the past about how this can be exacerbated by sharp rises in repo haircuts from currently very low &ndash; often zero &ndash; levels, and the consequences for financing conditions in the real economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></p>
<p>These long-term structural changes are not new and we have been talking about them for some time. But these different types of risks emerged against a backdrop of abundant liquidity, which dampened them somewhat. This may no longer be the case as the funding and liquidity environment has been changing over recent years. It is important for us now to consider whether liquidity is able to flow to where it is needed for the financial system to support the real economy, both in normal times and in stress. And in doing so we should recognise the more significant role that NBFIs play in providing that support.</p>
<h3>The funding and liquidity environment has been changing over recent years</h3>
<p>We are moving away from a post-GFC monetary policy stance of very low interest rates and very large central bank balance sheets where central bank reserves are abundant. This is a significant change given the key role central bank reserves play in how liquidity flows through the system, as the safest and most liquid of financial assets and the ultimate means of settlement.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>In the UK, the Bank of England&rsquo;s own balance sheet is shrinking as extraordinary monetary policy measures introduced in response to the GFC and Covid are being unwound. As a result, the overall stock of reserves in the system is decreasing and the way in which these reserves are supplied by the Bank is changing. As set out previously by several of my colleagues, we are transitioning towards a repo-led operating framework where the size of our balance sheet will reflect the liquidity needs of the system.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>This transition will require a change in how banks and non-banks manage their liquidity. In December 2023<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-8" id="footnote-ref-8"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>, we set out how the change in central bank balance sheets was leading to a number of system-wide trends that were likely to affect bank funding and liquidity. And we have consistently highlighted the need for banks to factor these trends into their liquidity management and planning. For example, the cost and availability of reserves will affect banks&rsquo; decisions to hold them versus other high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that can also be used to manage their liquidity.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-9" id="footnote-ref-9"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>We are now some way through this process. The Bank&rsquo;s reserves supply has fallen to around &pound;680bn from a peak of nearly &pound;980bn. Asset purchases are being unwound through quantitative tightening (QT) while cheap long-term funding provided through the Bank&rsquo;s crisis-era TFSME lending scheme is maturing or being repaid early by banks, with the amount outstanding declining from &pound;193bn to &pound;83bn.</p>
<p>The banking system has been adjusting to this change. Despite a shrinking supply of reserves, banks have maintained robust liquidity positions, with aggregate Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCRs) of 153% and 285% for large and smaller banks respectively.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-10" id="footnote-ref-10"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[9]</a></sup>&nbsp;Larger banks in particular have been replacing central bank reserves with gilts in their HQLA. And banks have increased their usage of both our Short-Term Repo (STR) and Indexed Long-Term Repo (ILTR) operations as intended. That has helped smooth through frictions in money markets and ensure that the supply shrinks at a manageable pace.</p>
<p>By adapting to this change, the banking system has been able to continue to support the real economy. Lending growth has picked up. Gross lending to households and businesses was 13% higher in the first five months of this year compared with the same period in 2024, with increases seen across all asset classes. Our most recent Agents&rsquo; intelligence suggests that SME financing conditions have improved and are now close to what Agents would assess as &ldquo;normal&rdquo;, having been unusually tight for several years. The FPC judges that credit conditions continue to reflect developments in macroeconomic conditions.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-11" id="footnote-ref-11"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[10]</a></sup>&nbsp;Banks have managed this while maintaining robust earnings. They have maintained net interest margins at around historical average levels, and their price-to-book ratios have risen in a way that reflects investor confidence in UK banks&rsquo; ability to maintain returns on equity around their cost of equity.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not just banks who are affected. The change in funding and liquidity landscape has knock-on implications for the availability of liquidity for NBFIs as well. Banks play a significant role in the provision of liquidity to them, and banks&rsquo; own liquidity position is one factor affecting their willingness to on-lend liquidity to others (in addition to capital and counterparty risk considerations).</p>
<h3>A new normal for funding and liquidity</h3>
<p>The reduction in central banks&rsquo; footprint in the financial system is in many ways a return to normal &ndash; even though it may not feel like it for many employees in the financial sector who haven&rsquo;t known anything else in their careers so far. But it is a new normal, reflecting the lessons learned during and since the GFC about the liquidity needs of banks, and of the system as a whole. It is important to consider how different parts of the financial system will continue to have access to the liquidity they need to support the real economy in this new normal.</p>
<p>The financial crisis revealed serious inadequacies in liquidity risk management practices by banks and other financial institutions. Post-GFC reforms have significantly strengthened micro-prudential regulation and supervision of liquidity risks, and we now have a much greater understanding of the importance of taking a system-wide view of liquidity. The PRA&rsquo;s liquidity supervision framework now includes rules targeted at the key aspects of a firm&rsquo;s liquidity risk management including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding Ratio and the Overall Liquidity Adequacy Rule. Leverage Ratio requirements have also been introduced as a backstop to the risk-weighted capital framework. These guard against the risk of excessive leverage in normal times that could result from the inherent errors and uncertainties in assigning risk weights, which could exacerbate liquidity strains during a stress. For their part, banks have taken the liquidity risk lessons from the crisis on board and manage their liquidity and leverage in a way that is more prudent than was the case prior to 2008.</p>
<p>As my colleague Vicky Saporta has set out, the Bank of England has also learned lessons in the way it provides liquidity and supplies reserves.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-12" id="footnote-ref-12"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[11]</a></sup>&nbsp;Our operating framework is now accessible to a much wider range of banks and we have introduced new facilities to supply reserves against a broad range of collateral, including contingent facilities that can be activated in stress. These facilities allow the supply of reserves to expand when needed, for example if there is an increase in demand for precautionary liquidity in a stress. We have taken steps to normalise regular usage of our facilities in a way which reduces stigma, emphasising that all of our facilities are &lsquo;open for business&rsquo;.</p>
<p>And we continue to learn. The experience of March 2023 highlights the importance of the composition of firms&rsquo; liquid assets and their ready access to central bank facilities in preparing them to deal with faster, larger liquidity shocks. The PRA intends to identify whether changes to the prudential liquidity framework are warranted to reflect these lessons, with any proposed changes subject to consultation in 2026.</p>
<p>Beyond banks, the 2020 dash-for-cash episode and the System-Wide Exploratory Scenario (SWES) provided valuable insights into how banks and NBFIs behave in a severe market-wide liquidity shock, and how their actions can interact to amplify stress across the financial system.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-13" id="footnote-ref-13"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[12]</a></sup>&nbsp;And we also continue to assess the liquidity risk implications of new forms of digital money.</p>
<h3>Accounting for the growing role of market-based finance</h3>
<p>So both the normalisation in the monetary policy environment and the shift in the provision of services from banks to non-banks are major trends for the financial sector. And my key point is this: we need to think about them together, not in isolation. The &lsquo;new normal&rsquo; for funding and liquidity has to take account of the growing importance of market-based finance. Now more than ever, we need to consider the liquidity demands of NBFIs as well as banks given their significant role in the provision of vital services to households and businesses.</p>
<p>This has changed the nature of liquidity flows through the financial system and the types of liquidity risk we are most concerned about. The funding and liquidity landscape influences business decisions by NBFIs, including the level of leverage in the non-bank sector and the types of risks taken by NBFIs. So we need to think about how to support continued provision of financial services by NBFIs in normal times, in a way that avoids unsustainable risk-taking and leverage, and that supports the financial system&rsquo;s ability to self-manage increased liquidity demands and self-stabilise in severe but plausible stresses. To ensure the central bank needs to step in only in extreme scenarios, not more often.</p>
<p>Unlike banks, NBFIs are not able to hold central bank reserves. They do not have the power to create money (in the form of commercial deposits).<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-14" id="footnote-ref-14"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[13]</a></sup>&nbsp;And they do not have regular access to central bank facilities, reflecting the different role they play in the financial system. This poses a unique challenge in ensuring that liquidity flows to them as well as banks. And it means that banks will continue to play a major role in providing liquidity to them, reflecting banks&rsquo; special role in the financial system, including their expertise in maturity transformation and credit risk management.</p>
<p>In sterling markets, one of the most important conduits for liquidity flows between banks and NBFIs is the gilt repo market, as it allows participants to effectively lend against gilts as collateral. What we are talking about here is quite different from the type of leverage that banks provide to the private equity ecosystem, which does not involve gilt repo but rather loans secured against collateral which is illiquid and hard to value &ndash; I have talked about those risks before.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-15" id="footnote-ref-15"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>With only a few notable exceptions, over the past decade the gilt repo market has remained a liquid and well-functioning market. Far from shrinking in the face of abundant central bank liquidity, as some predicted at the outset of quantitative easing, repo activity as a proportion of banking sector assets has remained broadly in line with pre-GFC levels. This is in part due to the increase in activity in NBFIs, and reflects the unique role of the repo market as a major vehicle through which banks are the main providers of liquidity, and with it leverage, to non-banks.</p>
<p>However, recent experience has shown that despite its size and liquidity in normal times, this crucial market can come under pressure when demands for liquidity, particularly from NBFIs, increase in a stress. In the 2020 dash-for-cash episode, gilt repo market functioning deteriorated sharply as market participants, including UK-based dealer banks, were unable to satisfy increased NBFI demand for liquidity to meet margin calls and redemptions. The LDI crisis also highlighted the difficulty in getting liquidity to flow where it was needed in stress. However, the challenge there was different as LDI funds needed less leverage not more and while pension funds had the incentive to borrow, they lacked the ability to do so in effective or timely ways.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-16" id="footnote-ref-16"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[15]</a></sup>&nbsp;So even in an environment of abundant central bank liquidity, there were impediments to liquidity flowing from, or through, banks to NBFIs in stress.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-17" id="footnote-ref-17"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[16]</a></sup></p>
<p>This is consistent with the findings of the SWES, which showed that despite higher NBFI demand for liquidity in the scenario, most banks had very little, if any, appetite to increase the amount of repo finance they extend to non-banks.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-18" id="footnote-ref-18"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[17]</a></sup>&nbsp;This was largely driven by counterparty credit risk concerns, against the backdrop of often zero haircuts. A deterioration in gilt repo market conditions can amplify forced gilt sales, threatening dysfunction in cash gilt markets. These two markets play a crucial role in the pricing of risk-free assets, which in turn underpins a wide set of other transactions. They help liquidity flow around the system, ultimately funding the provision of vital services to households and businesses. Because of this, dysfunction in these markets has costly implications for the real economy.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why one of our financial stability priorities is to enhance the resilience of liquidity in core markets, including gilt repo. It is natural to expect these markets to be impacted by large shocks, as it is likely that demand for liquidity will increase and participants might become more risk-averse and limit their liquidity provision. But we want to make sure that the structure of these markets, and the incentives participants face, mean that these impacts are manageable and that core markets remain sufficiently resilient so that they do not amplify the initial shock.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2023, the PRA completed a thematic review of regulated firms&rsquo; liquid fixed income financing (or &lsquo;matched book&rsquo; repo) businesses, sharing observations on the lessons learned from the large fluctuations in gilt markets in September and October 2022 and expectations that firms should incorporate these into their risk management practices.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-19" id="footnote-ref-19"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[18]</a></sup></li>
<li>We will soon publish an exploratory discussion paper on potential measures to build gilt repo market resilience, such as greater central clearing of gilt repo and minimum haircuts or margin requirements on non-centrally cleared gilt repo transactions. It will also seek views on a broader range of other potential initiatives.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-20" id="footnote-ref-20"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[19]</a></sup></li>
<li>And we have already enhanced our toolkit to step in through the launch of our Contingent Non-Bank Financial Institution Repo Facility (CNRF). While our preference remains for liquidity to flow via banks from our regular lending facilities to NBFIs, we recognise that in periods of very severe stress, intermediation capacity constraints can prevent banks from lending at sufficient scale to prevent spillover effects resulting in gilt market dysfunction that threatens UK financial stability. In such extraordinary situations, the CNRF provides a means of channelling liquidity directly to financially sound and resilient NBFIs.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-21" id="footnote-ref-21"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[20]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h3>Key principles for the new funding and liquidity landscape</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding the progress made, we are only part of the way through the journey to this new normal and we will continue to learn and adapt as we go.</p>
<p>Because of the unique role we play as both a central bank and a regulator, we have a number of levers that can affect the overall funding and liquidity landscape. These include: i) our monetary operating framework and the terms on which we provide liquidity to the system, ii) the regulatory framework for banks, including liquidity and leverage ratio policies, and iii) policies relevant to the markets in which banks and NBFIs operate.</p>
<p>In using those levers, it will be important to be clear about what our objectives are, to ensure that the set of policy choices we make across them is coherent. Clearly our overarching goal is to deliver the Bank&rsquo;s core statutory objectives of monetary and financial stability. But within that overarching goal we can set out three objectives:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, whatever frameworks we have in place, it is vital to maintain monetary control. As my colleague Vicky has set out, monetary control can be achieved under a range of different operating frameworks, although some frameworks may be more robust than others to unanticipated shifts in the demand for reserves.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-22" id="footnote-ref-22"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[21]</a></sup></li>
<li>Second, individual banks should maintain enough liquid assets, including reserves, to meet their own short-term stressed liquidity needs, taking into account their ability to liquidate these assets either with us or with the market. While this has always been important, management of liquidity risk prior to the GFC proved to be inadequate. Micro-prudential liquidity regulation and banks&rsquo; liquidity management practices have since improved substantially. And banks need to continue to adapt to changing liquidity risks, including the possibility of faster liquidity shocks in a digital world as highlighted by the experience of Silicon Valley Bank in March 2023.</li>
<li>And finally, reflecting what we have learned since 2008 and how the financial system has developed, it is important to supplement these monetary policy and microprudential aims with a macroprudential one. Namely that as well as ensuring that market rates remain close to Bank Rate, and that individual banks can withstand a liquidity stress, we seek to ensure that liquidity can flow around the financial system to get where it is needed most. By that I mean that banks and other financial institutions are appropriately incentivised to lend to one another, including in stress, thereby achieving an effective degree of liquidity recycling across the whole ecosystem. While some impact on liquidity provision in a severe stress is inevitable, we want core liquidity markets to be resilient enough so that they help to absorb rather than amplify the initial stress.</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be choices in how we use our policy levers to achieve these objectives. For example, the level of reserves banks choose to hold in normal times, and the way in which we supply them, will affect their level of asset encumbrance (i.e. how much of their assets are pledged or otherwise committed to us for use in our repo facilities). But as banks encumber more of their assets with us to obtain reserves through our repo facilities, it is important that they also maintain enough &lsquo;dry powder&rsquo; to source additional reserves from us in stress and also consider what collateral they have available to source liquidity from private sector funding markets.</p>
<h3>Liquidity getting to where it is needed most</h3>
<p>To meet these three objectives, we need to ensure that our decisions on the monetary operating framework and regulatory framework are coherent and tread a middle road as we make these choices. This middle road should ensure sufficient incentives for individual institutions to maintain liquidity insurance themselves and also provide incentives for them to support the liquidity of the system as a whole by lending in financial markets. And we need to ensure that funding markets are liquid and resilient in both normal and stressed times, paying close attention to how our policy choices can affect this resilience. That means ensuring liquidity is cheap enough to allow sufficient market depth in normal times, but without encouraging a build-up of unsustainable leverage in the system which would unravel in a stress.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for managing liquidity risks lies with financial institutions themselves, and this applies for both banks and NBFIs. When managing their liquidity needs, banks should take into account their ability to use our lending facilities regularly for routine liquidity management, which we encourage and welcome. We want to avoid any stigma around routine usage of these facilities in normal times, so that they can be more effective in stress. NBFIs also need to take a prudent approach to their own liquidity risk management, taking on board lessons from previous periods of market instability such as the 2022 Liability Driven Investment (LDI) episode.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-23" id="footnote-ref-23"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>That said, we also want to create a funding and liquidity environment which incentivises banks and NBFIs to participate actively in private sector funding markets, rather than hoarding liquidity excessively. This means that we need to be cognisant of potential distortions to banks&rsquo; and NBFIs&rsquo; incentives to lend to one another, and their capacity to warehouse risk, in both normal times and in stress. We want to encourage the efficient distribution, or recycling, of liquidity across the financial system and to support the efficiency and depth of intermediation in core private sector funding markets. The resilience of these core markets to stress remains crucial, as they underpin a wide set of transactions that ultimately support the provision of services to households and businesses. It is important that market participants, including NBFIs, maintain their own liquidity resilience so that these markets can self-stabilise in response to most shocks. The less efficiently private sector funding markets distribute liquidity in normal times, the less trained they are to cope with shocks, and therefore the more likely it is that central banks might have to step in.</p>
<p>Situations where central banks have to make extraordinary interventions should be rare. But we cannot eliminate liquidity risk altogether and it will remain the case that some shocks are so severe that intervention will be appropriate given the threat to UK financial stability. What we ultimately care about is how the provision of vital financial services would be affected. So as well as thinking about individual institutions&rsquo; liquidity needs, we need to consider how significant a role they play in providing those services as well as the potential for their liquidity stress to spread to other parts of the financial system. Given the growing significance of NBFIs, the CNRF is a valuable addition to our toolkit if we do need to intervene.</p>
<p>We should also be mindful of how the funding and liquidity environment can impact the overall level of leverage in the system and the types of risks taken, which in turn affect the size and likelihood of liquidity shocks emerging in stress. Whilst leverage in the financial system supports the depth of funding markets and growth in the real economy, we want to avoid the build-up of extreme leverage in normal times which can create destabilising fire-sales during periods of high volatility and pose very large risks to the real economy.<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2025/july/nathanael-benjamin-speech-at-omfif-economic-and-monetary-policy-institute#footnote-24" id="footnote-ref-24"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[23]</a></sup></p>
<h3>Closing remarks</h3>
<p>As I have set out in this speech, there are a lot of factors impacting future liquidity conditions for banks and non-banks that we need to consider together in the round. Normalisation in the monetary policy environment affects the overall level of system-wide liquidity, and the calibration of our repo lending facilities determines how banks can access liquidity from us. Banking regulation, including liquidity and leverage ratio policies, affects banks&rsquo; demand for holding reserves and other HQLA, their capacity to warehouse risk, and their incentives to distribute excess liquidity to other financial institutions. And there are a range of policy initiatives we can consider to improve the resilience of markets that are core to the distribution of liquidity, such as measures to encourage greater central clearing or minimum repo haircuts.</p>
<p>All of these factors affect the liquidity available to NBFIs, and hence their ability to support the real economy. And given the larger role market-based finance now plays in providing financial services to households and businesses, this is very important. In considering these different factors together, it is helpful to apply a macroprudential lens which considers how liquidity flows around the financial system.</p>
<p>If we get the calibration of incentives right across our monetary operating framework and regulatory frameworks, reserves should be neither scarce nor abundant &ndash; just ample. Banks would maintain an appropriate level of reserves for their own liquidity management purposes, taking into account the predictability and reliability of the Bank&rsquo;s liquidity provision. And outside of periods of exceptional monetary stimulus they would also have incentives not to hoard excess and unneeded liquidity, and would instead redistribute it to the rest of the system where it might be more needed.</p>
<p>Let me end on a practical note. Balancing the principles set out above to achieve the right calibration of incentives requires co-ordination on our part to ensure that policy choices are coherent across our monetary operating framework, our microprudential functions, and our macroprudential functions. Fortunately, the UK&rsquo;s institutional arrangements are well suited to this since the Monetary Policy Committee, Prudential Regulation Committee, and Financial Policy Committee are all housed under one roof. And that co-ordination is happening. We look forward to thinking through these macro issues in collaboration with the industry, towards a steady state which sets up the financial sector well to support households and businesses in a range of environments.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>Demand for &ldquo;OTRV julho 2031&rdquo; exceeds &euro;600 million</span></li>
<li><span>New Treasury Bonds to be listed on Euronext Lisbon from 18 July</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today announced the results of the issue of the new Floating Rate Treasury Bonds (Obriga&ccedil;&otilde;es do Tesouro de Rendimento Vari&aacute;vel &ndash; OTRV) maturing in July 2031, following the public subscription and exchange offer launched by the Republic of Portugal through IGCP &ndash; Ag&ecirc;ncia de Gest&atilde;o da Tesouraria e da D&iacute;vida P&uacute;blica. These bonds will be officially listed on Euronext Lisbon on 18 July 2025.</p>
<p>This transaction reinforces Euronext&rsquo;s ongoing commitment to supporting sovereign issuers and promoting broad access to capital markets for Portuguese retail investors, while further strengthening the vitality and depth of Euronext&rsquo;s global debt listing franchise.</p>
<p>The offering combined a public subscription open to all eligible retail investors in Portugal with a public exchange offer for holders of the &ldquo;OTRV julho 2025&rdquo; bonds. Both transactions were settled via Euronext Securities.</p>
<p>The total outcome of the offers, after validation, amounted to &euro;612,237,000, comprising &euro;423,421,000 from the public subscription and &euro;188,816,000 from the public exchange offer for holders of the &ldquo;OTRV julho 2025&rdquo; bonds.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;OTRV julho 2031&rdquo; attracted 24,149 retail investors, with the majority placing orders between &euro;11,000 and &euro;30,000.</p>
<p>This listing further highlights the pivotal role of Euronext&rsquo;s integrated market infrastructure in supporting government financing strategies, by ensuring transparency, liquidity, and accessibility for a broad investor base.</p>
<p>Isabel Ucha, CEO of Euronext Lisbon, said: &ldquo;<em>The successful admission to trading of the &ldquo;OTRV julho 2031&rdquo; is a clear demonstration of how capital markets - and in particular the Euronext&rsquo;s integrated model - play a crucial role in connecting the financing needs of sovereign issuers with investment opportunities for retail savers. The admission to trading of this bond diversifies the investor base for Portuguese government bonds, while offering a secure and transparent additional avenue for savings.&nbsp; By providing retail investors with access to a liquid, listed sovereign bond, this issuance promotes financial inclusion and broadens participation in the capital markets, offering more people the opportunity to directly support the country&rsquo;s economic future through their investment decisions. It also highlights the strength and resilience of Euronext Lisbon within Euronext&rsquo;s wider European infrastructure, ensuring transparency, liquidity and efficiency.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=d2IuYvvs-9_SEOkXTesXLFjPlpzXvjVc236fyIOMGp-O9x0tjxMpTuN5YuMujZ9UutVXz35N2OhIxG5Dh9Y7Z9Yir-FP5MV_Tp9RL6WzXaS6ZC3djvVk8Jqsp6YnUbxK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="CUSIP Global Services">CUSIP Global Services</a>&nbsp;(CGS) today announced the release of its CUSIP Issuance Trends Report for June 2025. The report, which tracks the issuance of new security identifiers as an early indicator of debt and capital markets activity over the next quarter, found a monthly increase in request volume for new corporate identifiers, while monthly request volume for new municipal identifiers declined slightly.</p>
<p>North American corporate CUSIP requests totaled 8,160 in June, which is up 4.1% on a monthly basis. On an annualized basis, North American corporate requests were down -1.9% over June 2024 totals. The monthly increase was driven by a 21.3% increase in request volume for new corporate equity identifiers, a 17.6% rise in request volume for U.S. corporate debt identifiers and a 6.4% increase in requests for Canadian corporate identifiers.</p>
<p>The aggregate total of identifier requests for new municipal securities &ndash; including municipal bonds, long-term and short-term notes, and commercial paper &ndash; fell 1.2% versus May totals. On a year-over-year basis, overall municipal volumes were up 16.8% through the end of June. New York led state-level municipal request volume with a total of 233 new CUSIP requests in June, followed by Texas (151) and California (136).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re continuing to see a healthy volume of new issuance activity, particularly in the corporate asset classes which have now seen monthly increases for two consecutive months,&rdquo; said Gerard Faulkner, Director of Operations for CGS. &ldquo;Against a backdrop of uncertainty about the future of interest rates and the economy, it will be instructive to see if issuers continue to bring new securities to market at this pace as we enter the second half of the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Requests for international equity CUSIPs rose 3.8% in June and international debt CUSIP requests rose 8.2%. On an annualized basis, international equity CUSIP requests were up 17.5% and international debt CUSIP requests were up 7.2%.</p>

The application will be open to all OTC bilateral derivatives traders upon its launch in Q3.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>This collaboration will leverage the Canton Network&rsquo;s unique privacy capabilities to create an on-chain collateral and margin management solution for bilateral derivatives. The move will address inefficiencies and constraints in the crypto derivatives market, which stem from the lack of a comprehensive and accessible regulatory framework.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Existing bilateral markets are often fully or over-collateralized, creating capital inefficiencies, while the use of tri-party agents for collateral management adds additional costs. Digital Asset's collaboration with these leading market participants will introduce an automated and cost-effective alternative powered by the Canton Network.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to welcome these new partners to the Canton Network as we expand the scope and impact of our on-chain margining initiative. This will serve the demand for enhanced privacy and capital-efficient infrastructure, and prove out the use case for traditional financial derivatives markets,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Georg Schneider, Head of Financial Products at Digital Asset</b>. &ldquo;We look forward to welcoming the firms on board and working closely with them to shape the future of finance.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>"At B2C2, we believe the widespread adoption of digital assets depends on infrastructure that matches traditional finance standards," stated&nbsp;<b>Cactus Raazi, CEO Americas at B2C2</b>. "As a top liquidity provider in institutional crypto markets, we're dedicated to building scalable solutions that connect traditional and digital finance. Canton's on-chain collateral solution is a crucial advancement, boosting capital efficiency, automation, and privacy in bilateral derivatives."</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;We are excited to support Canton&rsquo;s on-chain collateral solutions within our bilateral derivatives business,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Chris Zuehlke, Partner at DRW and Global Co-Head of Cumberland</b>. &ldquo;Our firm has long championed the adoption of blockchain technologies, and this initiative perfectly aligns with our mission to make markets more efficient through innovative solutions. We believe interoperable, privacy-enabled networks like Canton will play a critical role in the convergence of traditional and digital markets. As one of the largest liquidity providers in crypto options, we know first-hand that institutional investors are ready for this type of collateral management solution.&rdquo;<br /><br />&ldquo;We&rsquo;re pleased to contribute as a design partner in developing on-chain collateral settlement for bilateral derivatives,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<b>Joshua Lim, Global Co-Head of Markets at FalconX.</b>&nbsp;&ldquo;Exploring applications like this allows us to test new infrastructure that could support more efficient and secure trading between institutional participants.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>"The promise of crypto is true ownership of value, and seamless flexibility in its utilization. By developing solutions for on-chain derivative margin optimization on Canton, Digital Asset is bridging the liquidity gap between crypto-native players wanting access to institutional capital and traditional players venturing into the ever-expanding digital assets space. That capital efficiency unlock is here to stay," said&nbsp;<b>Simranjeet Singh, Head of DeFi Trading at GSR</b><br /><br />The collaboration will deliver a solution with several key capabilities, including on-chain collateral agreements encoded as smart contracts, which will enable the automatic execution and enforcement of terms in line with ISDA CSA Initial and Variation Margin compliance requirements. Using the Canton Network, parties gain real-time access to data shared only among transaction participants&ndash; allowing for streamlined automated margin workflows, instant tokenized collateral pledging, and improved dispute resolution. The solution also ensures the privacy of collateral transactions, limiting the access of confidential terms and on-chain movements to the relevant counterparties.<br /><br />The ability to provide on-chain collateral and margin management for bilateral derivatives on the Canton Network will offer several key advantages, including 24/7 margining regimes where margin can be paid on demand, shorter margin cycles, reduced risk and margin requirements, and the incorporation of novel collateral types such as yield-bearing stablecoins or tokenized money market funds.</span></p>

<title>Tariff-Driven Currency Volatility Hits North American Firms’ Profits, Driving Surge In FX Hedging</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>69% negatively impacted by tariff-driven currency volatility&nbsp;</li>
<li>83% have experienced losses due to unhedged risk&nbsp;</li>
<li>91% hedge risk, up from 82% in 2024 and 81% in 2023</li>
</ul>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>A new&nbsp;report&nbsp;from advanced FX and cash management solutions provider MillTech, has revealed that nearly seven in ten (69%) North American corporates have seen their profitability or competitiveness in international markets negatively impacted by currency volatility caused by US tariffs. Over four-fifths (83%) have experienced recent losses due to unhedged FX risk.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://milltech.com/resources/currency-insight-and-education/the-milltech-north-america-corporate-cfo-fx-report-2025" id="OWAecf39868-3478-bb12-b1b0-37513bf06f40" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://milltech.com/resources/currency-insight-and-education/the-milltech-north-america-corporate-cfo-fx-report-2025">The MillTech North American Corporate FX Report 2025</a>&nbsp;analyses the findings from a survey of 250 senior finance decision makers at corporates across the US and Canada, revealing how they are responding to tariff-driven volatility, accelerating geopolitical risk and heightened market volatility, and leveraging AI and automation.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Tariffs have become one of the biggest economic flashpoints of 2025,&nbsp;</span><span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/markets/navigating-market-volatility-amid-tariff-threats/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20tariff,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20pandemic." id="OWAa74e2c46-23ff-0d9b-9e13-e6c6e0b385e8" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/insights/markets/navigating-market-volatility-amid-tariff-threats/#:~:text=In%20the%20wake%20of%20tariff,the%20beginning%20of%20the%20pandemic.">dominating headlines and driving volatility</a></span></span><span>&nbsp;across global markets, causing issues for North American firms, especially those that don&rsquo;t hedge their FX risk. As a result, there are high hedging levels, with 91% currently hedging their FX risk, up from 82% last year and 81% in 2023. This is despite 94% reporting higher hedging costs, up sharply from 73% last year, with an average increase of 76%.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Firms are adjusting their hedging strategies to manage tariff-driven volatility, with 64% planning to increase hedge lengths. Average hedge tenors remain at a three-year low of just 4.9 months, suggesting the shift is still early or selective.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Nearly nine in ten (87%) firms have made changes to their sourcing and manufacturing strategies in ways that impact their FX transactions as a result of tariffs. Despite tariff concerns and changes they have been forced to make, the vast majority of firms (84%) remain optimistic, suggesting they believe the near-term tariff pain will be worth the long-term gain.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>Other key findings include:</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Biggest tariff concerns</b>&nbsp;&ndash; The top concerns are the impact on currency values (36%), high levels of uncertainty preventing major decisions from being made (34%), and counterparty risk in hedging transactions (33%).</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Firms that don&rsquo;t hedge are now considering it</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Of the firms that don&rsquo;t currently hedge their FX risk, more are considering hedging in 2025 (65%) than last year (51%). The top reason for not hedging was burdensome infrastructure, cited by 83% of firms, up from just 20% last year, suggesting they want to hedge but lack the tools.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>FX option adoption</b>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;The use of FX options is becoming more frequent, with 86% of corporates now incorporating them into their hedging strategies.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Fresh FX challenges for corporates</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Demonstrating best execution (33%) was the top challenge for North American corporates, followed by fragmented service provision (32%) and manual processes (30%). 94% also reported higher hedging costs, spiking from 73% in 2024.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>FX goes digital</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Firms are relying less on phone and email for booking FX trades. In 2025, 29% of firms use the phone to book FX transactions, down from 33% in 2024 and 35% in 2023. Just 24% use email for transactions, down from 27% in 2024 and 34% in 2023.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Shifting priorities</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Corporates refocused their attention towards FX costs in 2025, with transparency of costs (34%) being the top priority, while automation (32%) and the credit ratings of FX counterparties (29%) also ranked highly.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>The push for automation and AI</b>&nbsp;&ndash; Every business surveyed was found to be considering automating parts of their FX processes, with the most popular use case being price discovery (34%). 100% also reported to be exploring how AI can be used to enhance their FX operations, and the top use case was found to be process automation (43%).</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Outsourcing drive</b>&nbsp;&ndash; 100% of firms outsource some part of their FX process. The main drivers are access to specialized expertise, enhanced efficiency and automation, and scalability and flexibility in operations (30%).</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span><b>Eric Huttman, CEO of MillTech, commented</b>:&nbsp;&ldquo;Many corporate CFOs have traditionally treated FX like a duck in the corner of the room. They pay it little attention until it starts quacking loudly. In 2025, that quacking is impossible to ignore. North American businesses are facing an increasingly volatile landscape, with currency shocks and trade disruptions affecting their competitiveness and profitability.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;This has served as a wake-up call, and more firms are taking out insurance in the shape of FX hedging to protect their bottom lines, even despite hedging costs soaring. Many are reassessing their entire FX risk management infrastructure, ditching manual processes and adopting technology like AI and automating manual processes to improve speed, accuracy and decision-making.</span></p>
<p class="elementToProof"><span>&ldquo;For too long, currency risk has been treated as a background issue, quietly managed by treasury teams while broader business priorities took centre stage. But in an era where currency swings can erase quarterly gains, proactive FX risk management is essential. Businesses can no longer afford to ignore the duck. It's time to listen, prepare and build smarter, more resilient FX strategies.&rdquo;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Quant Insight, the breakthrough macro factor analytics company serving institutional investors globally, announced completion of its Series A funding round led by 7RIDGE.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg18d9left"><img align="middle" alt="QUANT INSIGHT LIMITED Logo" id="prnejpg18d9left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2731592/QUANT_INSIGHT_LIMITED_Logo.jpg" title="QUANT INSIGHT LIMITED Logo" /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investment will accelerate Quant Insight's global expansion, enhance its unique macro factor risk models, and strengthen its position as the leading provider of macro intelligence for modern investment management.</p>
<p><b>Solving the Hidden Macro Risk Challenge<br /></b>Quant Insight addresses a critical gap in portfolio management: the inability to quantify macro exposures that drive over 50% of equity returns during market stress. While traditional risk models focus on equity style factors, macro risks drive returns during market volatility.</p>
<p>"Macro factors increasingly challenge equity investors' ability to generate alpha, yet they remain hard to quantify," said Mahmood Noorani, CEO of Quant Insight. "Our platform provides this critical missing piece&mdash;quantifiable macro factor intelligence that complements traditional style factor models."</p>
<p><b>Strategic Partnership for Fintech Excellence<br /></b>7RIDGE brings exceptional domain expertise with a proven track record scaling enterprise-facing technologies for trading, capital markets, and investment management. The firm's portfolio includes Digital Asset Holdings, Trading Technologies, and Raft Technologies.</p>
<p>"Quant Insight represents exactly the type of transformative technology that makes the global financial system more robust and efficient," said Carsten Kengeter, CEO of 7RIDGE. "Quant Insight's macro risk analytics fill a genuine market need with rigorous quantitative methodology. We're excited to leverage our capital markets expertise to help scale their platform globally."</p>
<p><b>Proven Technology<br /></b>Quant Insight's platform provides three core solutions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li><b>Macro Factor Equity Risk Model (MFERM)</b>: Decomposes portfolio returns into explainable macro components and provides clarity on macro exposure</li>
<li><b>Cross-Asset Valuation Engine</b>: Identifies macro dislocations and fair value gaps across asset classes</li>
<li><b>Asset Management Solutions</b>: Construction of active ETFs and risk hedging products</li>
</ul>
<p>The technology covers 13,000+ global assets with API integration and partnerships with leading risk platforms.</p>
<p><b>Growth and Innovation</b></p>
<p>The Series A funding will enable global expansion, enhanced platform capabilities with machine learning, scaled operations, and new applications for macro intelligence.</p>

<p>According to the MM Art Indices, based on auction records (since 1873) from Sotheby's, Christie's, and Phillips across major global cities, Asia-Africa-Oceania recorded the strongest long-term growth, with a CAGR of 7.7%, despite a 6.4% decline in Spring 2025. The Americas rebounded sharply by 31.7%, while Europe increased by 22.4%, nearly recovering pandemic-era losses, though its long-term growth remains more modest at 2.3% CAGR. "These regional patterns reflect deeper economic shifts," said&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.8CiUkFrLGqa7ynIpBWoM0ixhNOpX-2FAIyGE8naQGxs2iuA95YjIQ4shJ4424DedM87ielwupoFa3TbXaZw05zEw-3D-3DoeaV_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJHobyF8b-2F5wpYkzDkgq8PVaGqslY8e9qCU5f4nAJX3SsJZgD0wYMjT-2BzjLaptVvu9XNLyLnxqtR1ZeN8YK4M4W2J46lfJxQlBmInF5qCOgxM4qJqKWoA9V9kdmDe3WYJF8QHtUsHou2bR5dK99kMD0Ar0-2F5LUU6267kjUjuJDZBu8iCTcFh-2Bsg0HuADpDM26k41Tr3TFehyKxfRkegyvNe6Vxuka3cfN30OVBy6iZqQ0rJh-2BTUr0UdOL7YIkMYGucxFGKoQ03lzay0CMoJyWBty9ud85cEAaaAWSEkplLRhg-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mei Jianping</a>, CKGSB Professor of Finance. "Europe's market is mature and stable, while the Americas show postwar expansion and volatility. Asia's growth, driven by China and India, is rapid but uneven." The Chinese art market rebounded by 9% in Spring 2025, despite a 48.2% drop from its 2020 peak.</p>
<p>By combining the Sotheby's Mei &amp; Moses Index (1928&ndash;2000) with the MM Art Indices (2000&ndash;2024), researchers found that 10-year rolling returns on art turned negative in 2023-2024&ndash;the worst in 70 years. "We're seeing a rare alignment of market conditions that suggest art may be undervalued on a historical basis," said Mei. "For long-term collectors, this could represent a strategic entry point into the market."</p>
<p>CKGSB and SDA Bocconi have signed an MOU to co-develop new tools, including&nbsp;European country-level indices&nbsp;and&nbsp;sentiment metrics, under the newly launched&nbsp;Art Market and Finance Monitor&nbsp;at SDA Bocconi.

<title>SET Signals End Of Climate ‘Claims’ Era As Credible Transition Plan Now Dictates Financial Consequences And Corporate Futures</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h4><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">KEY POINTS</span></b><b>&nbsp;</b></h4>
<ul>
<li><b>SET signals that climate claims must be substantiated by high-quality data and measurable climate actions to establish credibility and drive financial consequences.</b></li>
<li><b>The forum discussed a financial, fiscal, insurance, and capital markets framework to support the private sector's transition to a low-carbon economy, urging businesses to leverage new regulations as a strategic opportunity.</b></li>
<li><b>Global and Thai capital market experts confirmed that sustainability data and credible Corporate Transition Plans are now critical, non-negotiable inputs in real-world capital allocation and business valuation decisions.</b><b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) today convened the SET Sustainability Forum 2/2025 under the theme<b> </b>&ldquo;Claims, Consequences, and Credibility: Capital Market for Climate Action.&rdquo;<b> </b>The event sent a decisive signal to the market is now transitioning to a new paradigm where verifiable &ldquo;credibility&rdquo; and measurable climate actions will directly determine financial &ldquo;consequences,&rdquo; fundamentally impacting corporate competitiveness and access to long-term capital.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>NXPO Board Member, and Independent Director, Chairman of the Technology Committee, Member of the Executive Committee of </b><b>SCBX</b><b> Dr. Pailin Chuchottaworn</b> asserted in his keynote address, &ldquo;Proof Your Climate Pledges as Grounded Governance,&rdquo; that Net Zero targets are unattainable without robust corporate governance. A Net Zero pledge, without being embedded in the core strategy and rigorously overseen by the board, risks being perceived as mere corporate branding. True credibility is forged through transparent accountability mechanisms that link climate targets to business plans, capital allocation, and executive accountability, ensuring pledges are translated into organizational policies and practices, thereby mitigating greenwashing risks that erode investor trust.</p>
<p class="firstmt-15"><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Dr. Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> unveiled a three-year strategic plan to build a credible capital market ecosystem and support Thailand&rsquo;s Net Zero transition. &ldquo;Amid heightened global investor expectations, SET is accelerating the enhancement of our data infrastructure via the ESG Data Platform and GHG data management systems, while preparing for the development of a national carbon market infrastructure. Our objective is to ensure climate-related disclosures from Thai listed companies meet global standards, enabling effective investment analysis and reinforcing confidence in the Thai capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="firstmt-15">The forum&rsquo;s first panel, <b>&ldquo;Multi-Regulatory Approach: Enabling Thailand's Climate Transition,&rdquo;</b> demonstrated a cohesive regulatory front, outlining how financial, fiscal, insurance and capital market policies are being aligned to support the private sector&rsquo;s transition and provide clear pathways for businesses to adapt and access transition finance.</p>
<p>The second panel, <b>&ldquo;Investment Consequences: Allocating Capital for Credible Transition,&rdquo;</b> provided a forensic examination of how data is now being used by capital allocators. The panelists unanimously confirmed that credible sustainability data and transition&nbsp;plans are now actively used to make capital allocation decisions, from adjusting corporate valuations and structuring the terms of sustainability-linked finance to issuing sustainable funds and assessing systemic risks to the broader economy.</p>
<p>The forum also featured a global perspective from a representative of the London Stock Exchange Group (LSEG) on "Tracking Transition: The Science of Climate Credibility," offering insights into international best practices for monitoring and assessing the credibility of corporate climate transitions.</p>

<title>GLEIF Launches Global vLEI Hackathon In Collaboration With Key Industry Leaders - Global Organizational Identity Ecosystem Challenged To Shape The Future Of Digital Trust</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gleif-launches-global-vlei-hackathon-in-collaboration-with-key-industry-leaders-2025716/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.gleif.org/en/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation</a>&nbsp;(GLEIF) announces today the official launch of the vLEI Hackathon &ndash;&nbsp;a global innovation challenge in digital organizational identity. This new initiative aims to catalyze innovation and promote cross-industry collaboration to develop novel applications for the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI).</p>
<p>The vLEI is a digital, trustworthy attestation of the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) tied to the ISO-Standard 17442.&nbsp;This highly secure digital credential links an organization's identity with that of a natural person and the specific role they hold within the organization.&nbsp;By enabling peer-to-peer verification, the vLEI allows transactions, data, and credentials to be verified, trusted, and shared through peer-to-peer mechanisms without dependence on intermediaries or centralized platforms. This lays the foundation for the future of the digital economy &ndash; empowering legal entities everywhere with the confidence and freedom to trust and be trusted globally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>GLEIF invites developers, entrepreneurs, policy stakeholders, and innovators around the world to take part in the vLEI Hackathon and explore its potential across three key thematic areas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital Assets &amp; Financial Infrastructure</li>
<li>Industry, Commercial &amp; Finance Processes &amp; Operations</li>
<li>Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, and SME Finance</li>
</ul>
<p>Participating teams will develop and submit their solutions via the APIX Platform, where full details of the challenges are available. Following independent assessment by an international judging panel of experts, winners and runner-ups will be invited to present their solutions at exclusive in-person events this year in New York at Chainlink SmartCon, which brings governments, financial institutions, and blockchain projects together to discuss the technologies transforming global&nbsp;markets (3rd November), during the Hong Kong Fintech Week (7th November), and at GLEIF&rsquo;s digital ORG ID Forum co-hosted with Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management in Frankfurt am Main (2nd December).</p>
<p>The vLEI Hackathon enjoys the steadfast support of leading organizations, including Affinidi, Apix, Cardano Foundation, Chainlink, Cardano, EPA Asia, Esatus, the Finternet Lab, Frankfurt School of Finance &amp; Management, fts.money, GFTN Europe, Giesecke+Devrient, ICC Digital Standards Initiative, Key State Capital, Swift, Hong Kong PKI Forum, Vayana, Veriable.Trade and more.&nbsp;Additionally, the vLEI Hackathon will contribute to the further development of the ecosystem supported by Qualified vLEI Issuers (QVIs), including Certizen Technology, China Financial Certification Authority (CFCA), Finema, Global vLEI, Provenant, and TradeGo, which will also play central roles.</p>
<p>Alexandre Kech, CEO at GLEIF, comments: "The vLEI is a transformative leap forward in digital organizational identity, one that empowers organizations and individuals alike to operate with greater transparency and confidence across borders, infrastructures, and ecosystems. The vLEI Hackathon is our call to technology innovators everywhere to create innovative vLEI applications that will shape the future of digital trust. With our global partners, we are bringing together diverse expertise from a range of industries to explore and expand the use cases of the vLEI in real-world scenarios."</p>
<p>Fernando Vazquez,&nbsp;President, Capital Markets at Chainlink, comments: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to collaborate with GLEIF for the vLEI Hackathon and bring verifiable identity credentials onchain, which is the key unlock institutions need to deploy compliant digital assets in production and at a global scale. With Chainlink Automated Compliance Engine and GLEIF vLEIs, developers can now, for the first time, build production-ready digital asset applications with institutional-grade identity and compliance from day one.&rdquo;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p class="spanHeading"><span>Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX) today (Wednesday) published&nbsp;</span><span><span class="spanHeading"><span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/News-Release/2025/250716news/HKEX-Accelerated-Settlement-Paper-2025-v10-EN-(cover).pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span><span>a discussion paper</span></span></a></span></span><a href="https://www.hkex.com.hk/-/media/HKEX-Market/News/News-Release/2025/250716news/HKEX-Accelerated-Settlement-Paper-2025-v10-EN-(cover).pdf"><span class="spanHeading"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span></span></a>&nbsp;</span><span class="spanHeading">examining the accelerated settlement for the Hong Kong cash equities market, aiming to lead market-wide discussion and build consensus with industry participants on how and when to move to a shorter settlement cycle for Hong Kong.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX's cash market has been operating under a T+2 settlement cycle since 1992, while other cash markets globally have also been gradually shortening to a T+2 cycle over the past two decades. More recently, many markets have moved or are considering moving to a T+1 or faster settlement cycle.&nbsp;</span><span>By the end of 2027, up to 88 per cent<span>1</span>&nbsp;of cash equities globally by trade value will be in T+1 or T+0 markets, according to HKEX's analysis<span>&nbsp;</span>based on World Federation of Exchanges and global exchange statistics.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>The discussion paper outlines the potential benefits and challenges of shortening the current T+2 settlement cycle in Hong Kong, referencing the experience of other jurisdictions during their transition journey, offering the basis for all stakeholders to join an informed discussion.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX Chief Executive Officer, Bonnie Y Chan, said: "As a market operator, HKEX is fully committed to supporting the continued modernisation of Hong Kong's financial market infrastructure, ensuring that our financial ecosystem remains robust and fit for purpose. We are therefore delighted to be launching a discussion paper to lead the conversation on how and when to move to a shorter settlement cycle for our cash equities market."</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>"In a rapidly evolving global market landscape, there is urgency to seek a way forward, and we must as a financial community collaborate and act decisively to implement necessary enhancements. By leading the conversation, we&nbsp;</span><span>hope to build consensus and develop a detailed implementation timeline that incorporates comprehensive stakeholder feedback. We encourage market participants to actively participate in this discussion, and we look forward to hearing from you."</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>As the discussion paper shows, transitioning to T+1 in Hong Kong brings both benefits and challenges. Potential benefits include enhanced market efficiency, reduced systemic risk, and closer alignment with global markets. At the same time, a transition also presents challenges, particularly for market participants navigating time zone differences, foreign exchange transactions, and shorter post-trade timelines. To adapt, market participants would need to upgrade systems, automate processes and&nbsp;</span>coordinate across the market ecosystem to maintain efficiency and stability.</p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>For the avoidance of doubt, the settlement cycle acceleration under discussion covers secondary transactions in the Hong Kong Cash Market. Primary transactions such as Initial Public Offerings aren't included in this discussion.</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>HKEX will actively engage market participants and stakeholders in this discussion and welcome their feedback.&nbsp;</span><span>Industry participants are encouraged to read this paper, consider their existing circumstances, and respond on the topics of discussion by</span><span>&nbsp;submitting their feedback through&nbsp;</span><span><span class="spanHeading"><a href="https://surveys.hkex.com.hk/jfe/form/SV_bIXoW1NcG9aTnAG" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span><span>this portal</span></span></a>&nbsp;</span></span><span>by 1 September 2025 (Monday).</span></p>
<p class="spanHeading"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<p><span>1. Markets operating under a T+1 or T+0/T+1 basis currently include Mainland China, the US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and India, and this is expected to also include the European Economic Area, the UK, and Switzerland by 2027.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Worldline [Euronext: WLN], a global leader in payment services, today announces the launch of its AI-powered routing solution, changing how businesses route payments globally. Following successful pilots, the solution has delivered increased authorisation rates by more than 2% in addition to the 3% improvement achieved with its rule-based routing.</span></p>
<p>Payments are routed through acquirers, and choosing the most suitable one leads to increased authorisation and optimised costs. Worldline&rsquo;s enhanced routing solution now leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to analyse transaction data and select optimal payment routes in real time to further uplift conversion rates. Some of the pilot merchants experiencing an uplift of over 2% in authorisation rates (on top of 3% with rule-based routing). The existing rules-based solution routes transactions to the acquirer with low interchange fee, with one customer witnessing a &euro;1.63M boost in revenue.</p>
<p>By boosting authorisation rates and reducing cost, Worldline helps customers to maximise profit margins with no extra effort. The solution offers a unique dual-layered routing strategy, combining the reliability of predefined rules with the adaptability of machine learning. This allows businesses to adjust their payment processes to fit specific operational needs.</p>
<p>Key features of the full solution include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Omnichannel capability: the rules-based service can be used from multiple touchpoints for both online and in store transactions.</li>
<li>Global reach: supports multi-currency, multi-acquirer environments with intelligent cross-border payment handling.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
<li>AI-powered routing: this feature used global online businesses selects the most favourable acquirers, increasing conversion rates.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><b>Khalil Kammoun, Head of shared services at Worldline,</b>&nbsp;commented:&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;With AI-driven routing, we're enhancing authorisation rates through smarter decision-making and unlocking new revenue for our customers. At Worldline, we view payments as a growth driver for businesses and through this solution, we are delivering on that promise. Our aim is to enable businesses to achieve new levels of efficiency, cost savings, and payment optimisation.&rdquo;</i></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Worldline&rsquo;s AI-based solution is already being used by global e-commerce customers and will soon be available for other Worldline payment platforms. The solution positions Worldline as a trusted innovator and leader in the global payments industry, setting a new benchmark for intelligent transaction management.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Barclays £42 Million For Poor Handling Of Financial Crime Risks</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Barclays Bank UK PLC and Barclays Bank PLC a total of &pound;42 million for separate instances of failings in its financial crime risk management &ndash; one relating to WealthTek and one relating to Stunt &amp; Co.&nbsp; Barclays Bank UK PLC will make a voluntary payment to WealthTek&rsquo;s clients.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In the first case, Barclays Bank UK PLC failed to check it had gathered sufficient information to understand the money laundering risk, before opening a client money account for WealthTek.</p>
<p>One simple check it could have done was to look at the Financial Services Register before opening the account. Had it done so, it would have seen that WealthTek was not permitted by the FCA to hold client money.</p>
<p>Without the right information about WealthTek and how the account would be used, there was an increased risk of misappropriation of client money or money laundering. Clients went on to deposit &pound;34 million into the account. &nbsp;Barclays has agreed to make a voluntary payment of &pound;6.3 million to WealthTek&rsquo;s clients who have a shortfall in the money they have been able to reclaim. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-charges-john-dance-offences-related-wealthtek" title="FCA charges John Dance with offences related to WealthTek">December 2024</a>, the FCA separately charged WealthTek&rsquo;s principal partner with multiple criminal offences, including money laundering and fraud.</p>
<p>In the second case, the FCA has fined Barclays Bank PLC &pound;39.3 million for failing to adequately manage money laundering risks associated with providing banking services to Stunt &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Barclays did not gather enough information at the start of the relationship or carry out proper ongoing monitoring. In the space of just over a year, Stunt &amp; Co received &pound;46.8 million from Fowler Oldfield, a multimillion-pound money laundering operation.</p>
<p>Barclays failed to properly consider the money laundering risks associated with the firm even after receiving information from law enforcement about suspected money laundering through Fowler Oldfield, and after learning that the police had raided both firms.</p>
<p>Barclays only conducted a review of its exposure to Fowler Oldfield through its customers, including Stunt &amp; Co, after it learned of the FCA&rsquo;s decision to prosecute NatWest over their relationship with Fowler Oldfield. &nbsp;By providing ongoing banking services to Stunt &amp; Co, Barclays facilitated the movement of funds linked to financial crime.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, Joint Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'The consequences of poor financial crime controls are very real &ndash; they allow criminals to launder the proceeds of their crimes, and they allow fraudsters to defraud consumers. Banks need to take responsibility and act promptly, particularly when obvious risks are brought to their attention.</p>
<p>'In the first of these cases, Barclays secured a significant reduction in its fine through its extensive co-operation with our investigation and through making a voluntary payment to affected consumers at our request.'</p>
<p>Barclays continues to engage and invest in a significant remediation programme to enhance its anti-money laundering control framework.</p>
<p>Financial crime is highlighted by the FCA as a priority for retail banks in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-fca-strategy-retail-banks-2025.pdf" title="portfolio-letter-fca-strategy-retail-banks-2025.pdf">2024 supervisory strategy</a>. The FCA continues to supervise firms to improve standards and ensure that they have the right systems and controls to manage financial crime risks.&nbsp;</p>

<li>In the first case, Barclays Bank UK PLC was fined&nbsp;&pound;3,093,600, reduced from &pound;4,419,500 following early settlement.</li>

<li>Until recently, the FCA has prioritised our investigation into Mr Dance. Consideration was subsequently given to what further regulatory action might be appropriate. The investigation into Barclays Bank UK PLC was opened in April 2025 and concluded within three months. Barclays' extensive cooperation contributed to this expedited outcome. This, together with Barclays&rsquo; agreement to make a voluntary payment, led to a significant reduction in its financial penalty.</li>
<li>In respect of the second case, Barclays Bank PLC was fined &pound;39,314,700, reduced from &pound;56,163,900 following early settlement.</li>
<li>On 4 March 2025 Gregory Frankel and Daniel Rawson, who were both directors of Fowler Oldfield, were&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.cps.gov.uk/cps/news/four-people-jailed-one-largest-money-laundering-cases-uk" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">convicted of money laundering and&nbsp;sentenced<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>&nbsp;to more than 11 years and 10 years in prison respectively.

<title>FESE: New Oliver Wyman Report Sets Out Recommendations On How To Address Liquidity Fragmentation In The EU</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Federation of European Securities Exchanges (FESE) welcomes the release&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2025/jul/european-capital-markets-fragmentation-liquidity-gap.html">&lsquo;<em>The Liquidity Matrix: Addressing fragmentation in European equity markets</em>&rsquo;</a>, an independent report written and produced by management consultancy Oliver Wyman. As the European Commission advances its work on the Savings and Investments Union (SIU), the report offers timely insights into how the European Union (EU) can strengthen its equity markets to support investment and long capital formation requirements.</p>
<p>The EU must secure company financing to support key transitions, competitiveness, and defence. Achieving these goals requires mobilising more private capital and making the EU attractive for listings, which depends on having liquid, integrated, and well-functioning capital markets.</p>
<p>This report identifies persistent fragmentation in the EU&rsquo;s secondary equity markets as a key challenge. Despite high savings levels, European households allocate a relatively modest portion to capital markets. Liquidity is dispersed, trading activity is diluted across venues, and price formation and investor access are hindered.</p>
<p>The report&rsquo;s findings are clear: Vibrant secondary markets are essential to the functioning of Europe&rsquo;s financial ecosystem. Deep, inclusive, and efficient secondary markets drive better price formation, reduce the cost of capital, and support companies in securing long-term financing. The connection between secondary and primary markets is pivotal for attracting IPOs within the EU and advancing economic growth and innovation.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, efforts to reduce fragmentation across different execution channels &ndash; while safeguarding innovation and competition &ndash; will be essential to achieving a more integrated and liquid European capital markets<span>.</span></p>
<p>Commenting on the release of the new report, FESE President,&nbsp;<span>Niels Brab</span>, remarked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>This report is an important contribution to the ongoing debate on the integration of capital markets. It is a complex discussion that requires a balanced approach. With this report, we aim to provide a clear vision of the feasible options on the table, reaffirming our strong support for the Savings and Investment Union (SIU).</span></p>
<p><span>The EU must ensure a framework that fosters competition without hindering a fair level playing field and overly fragmenting liquidity. A framework that reduces cost and complexity while improving transparency and inclusion. We want companies to list in the EU to drive economic growth and increase fiscal revenues in order to strengthen the EU&rsquo;s global competitiveness and strategic sovereignty.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span>Magnus Burkl</span>, CFA, Head of Capital Markets Europe at Oliver Wyman, one of the study&rsquo;s authors, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>While Europe&rsquo;s capital markets are fragmented, they are functioning and resilient. The biggest lever to improve European competitiveness is to boost demand by activating the Capital Flywheel and encouraging long-term investments.</span></p>
<p><span>In parallel, the European Union should make most of existing demand by reducing intra-market fragmentation of liquidity across different trading venues and channels for individual stocks. This fragmentation is responsible for almost 70% of fragmentation in Europe. However, the impacts on innovation and competition should be carefully weighed. The challenge is to find the right balance in response to Europe&rsquo;s evolving policies and economic priorities.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FESE is pleased to support the development of the evidence base for the Savings and Investments Union (SIU) and reaffirms its commitment to promoting measures that enhance the ability of capital markets to serve the European economy and society effectively.</p>
<h4><span>About the study</span></h4>
<p>The study provides recommendations to better integrate capital markets. The study was commissioned and paid for by FESE but has been independently written and produced by Oliver Wyman.</p>

<title>Hong Kong’s AUM Grew 13% With 81% Increase In Fund Inflows: Hong Kong Securities And Futures Commission's (2024 Survey On Asset And Wealth Management Business</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="newsc">
<p>Hong Kong rode a new wave of growth as a pre-eminent international asset and wealth management hub, notching a robust year-on-year gain of 13% in assets under management (AUM) and an 81% surge in net fund inflows last year, according to the Securities and Futures Commission's (SFC)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sfc.hk/-/media/EN/files/COM/Reports-and-surveys/EN_AWMAS-2024.pdf?rev=b5a3bd4768b34f3185b421ca91f70750&amp;hash=532732D531ED17BDC46927632F1F09A8" target="_blank">Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey 2024&nbsp;</a>published today (Notes 1, 2 and 3).</p>
<p>The total AUM rose to $35.1 trillion (US$4.53 trillion) for Hong Kong&rsquo;s asset and wealth management business as at end-2024, powered by net fund inflows of $705 billion (US$91 billion) (Note 4). In particular, the AUM of private banking and private wealth management business grew 15% year-on-year to $10.4 trillion (US$1.3 trillion).</p>
<p>Hong Kong-domiciled funds authorised by the SFC also showed robust growth. Their net asset value increased 22% to $1.64 trillion (US$211 billion) as at end-2024 and further grew 21% to $1.99 trillion (US$256 billion) as at end-May 2025. They recorded net fund inflows of $163 billion (US$20.9 billion) during 2024, followed by $237 billion (US$30.5 billion) during the first five months of 2025 (Note 5).</p>
<p>Leveraging their global investment management expertise, the city&rsquo;s asset managers allocated 59% of assets outside Mainland China and Hong Kong. Their non-equity investment grew 13 percentage points to 59% over the past five years, reflecting a shift towards more diversified strategies in response to rapidly-changing global conditions.</p>
<p>The survey results coincide with the findings of the recently published Boston Consulting Group&rsquo;s (BCG) Global Wealth Report 2025, which ranked Hong Kong alongside Switzerland as the world&rsquo;s top-two cross-border wealth centre in 2024. According to BCG's report<span>,</span>&nbsp;the city&nbsp;recorded the&nbsp;highest absolute growth of US$231 billion in cross-border wealth, and the 9.6% year-on-year increase also outperformed the global average.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong is gaining more clout than ever as a leading international hub for asset and wealth management, propelled by strong fund inflows, financial innovation and a growing talent pool," said Ms Christina Choi, the SFC's Executive Director of Investment Products. "The SFC is committed to supporting Hong Kong&rsquo;s continued advancement as a full-service international financial centre and a leading offshore renminbi hub through fixed income and currency market developments."</p>
<p>Other highlights of the SFC&rsquo;s report include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Net fund inflows for the asset management and fund advisory business soared 571% to $321 billion (US$41.3 billion) in 2024.</li>
<li>The number of registered open-ended fund companies (OFCs) continued to show strength with 93% year-on-year surge in 2024, as asset managers further took advantage of Hong Kong&rsquo;s corporate fund structure and the associated government grants.</li>
<li>Mainland-related firms in the city continued to expand with 15% growth in their asset and wealth management AUM to $3.1 trillion (US$397 billion), outperforming the industry average for a fifth year in a row. Their net fund inflows jumped 68%.</li>
<li>The number of firms licensed to manage assets (Type 9 regulated activity) in Hong Kong increased by 4% to 2,212.</li>
</ul>
<p>More details of the survey can be found in the Appendix of this press release.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asset and wealth management business comprises asset management, fund advisory, private banking and private wealth management, SFC-authorised real estate investment trusts and assets held under trusts.</li>
<li>This year, 1,237 firms took part in the SFC&rsquo;s annual Asset and Wealth Management Activities Survey, including SFC-licensed corporations engaging in asset management and fund advisory business, banks engaging in asset management, private banking and private wealth management business, and non-SFC licensed insurance companies registered under the Insurance Ordinance and trustees.</li>
<li>There are entities conducting their own investment and wealth management activities in Hong Kong that may not be required to obtain a licence under the Securities and Futures Ordinance, such as single family offices, sovereign wealth funds and endowments. This survey does not include the aforementioned entities or direct investments by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.</li>
<li>Unless stated otherwise, values given are in Hong Kong dollars and all comparisons are made on a year-on-year basis (ie, 2024 over 2023). Amounts shown in US dollars were converted at the prevailing exchange rate.</li>
<li>The number of Hong Kong-domiciled SFC-authorised funds increased to 954 in 2024 and further increased to 987 at end-May 2025.</li>

<title>Jonathan V. Gould Takes Office As The 32nd Comptroller Of The US Currency</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/jonathan-v-gould-takes-office-as-the-32nd-comptroller-of-the-us-currency-2025716/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Jonathan V. Gould today became the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency, after being sworn into the office by Dr. Michael Faulkender, Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.</p>
<p>President Donald J. Trump nominated Mr. Gould on February 11, 2025, and the U.S. Senate confirmed him on July 10, 2025. Mr. Gould takes over from Rodney E. Hood, who has served as Acting Comptroller of the Currency for the past five months.</p>
<p>Mr. Gould issued the following statement upon becoming Comptroller:</p>
<p><em>It is a tremendous honor to serve as the 32nd Comptroller of the Currency. I am grateful to President Trump for his faith and confidence in nominating me. And I thank the Senate for confirming me last week, Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent for his support throughout my confirmation process, and Deputy Secretary Dr. Michael Faulkender for administering the oath of office to me earlier today.</em></p>
<p><em>I am delighted to return to the OCC where I last served as its Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel from 2018 to 2021. As noted in my Senate testimony, I believe in President Lincoln&rsquo;s vision of a national banking system that exists to support the U.S. economy. That system is today one of the crown jewels of American finance. But we should not take it for granted. As Comptroller, I will do everything in my power to ensure its continued relevance and ability to support the financial aspirations of all of us.</em></p>
<p><em>I look forward to working with the dedicated and accomplished professionals of the agency to ensure a safe and sound banking system, improve bank supervision and regulation, embrace innovation, and promote fair access to financial services.</em></p>
<p><em>I want to thank Rodney Hood for returning to public service and serving as Acting Comptroller of the Currency during the last five months. OCC employees have benefitted from his leadership guiding their work, and I wish him continued success.</em></p>
<p>Prior to becoming Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Gould was a partner at the law firm Jones Day. He previously served as the Senior Deputy Comptroller and Chief Counsel at the OCC and twice served on the staff of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, including as its chief counsel. He has spent the bulk of his career in the private sector as a consultant and lawyer, advising banks and other financial services firms on regulatory matters and risk management.</p>
<p>Mr. Gould holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Princeton University and a law degree from Washington and Lee University.</p>

<title>SIFMA Testimony Before The House Financial Services Committee Hearing “Dodd-Frank Turns 15: Lessons Learned And The Road Ahead”</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/sifma-testimony-before-the-house-financial-services-committee-hearing-dodd-fran-2025716/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Kenneth E. Bentsen, Jr., President and CEO of SIFMA, today&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/testimony/testimony-on-dodd-frank-turns-15-lessons-learned-and-the-road-ahead/">testified</a>&nbsp;before the House Financial Services Committee at a hearing titled&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Dodd-Frank Turns 15: Lessons Learned and the Road Ahead.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;Bentsen highlighted the resilience of U.S. capital markets while urging policymakers to reassess and recalibrate aspects of the regulatory framework to better balance stability with economic growth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. securities markets are the deepest and most liquid in the world. They are also the envy of the world,&rdquo; Bentsen said in the testimony. &ldquo;Vibrant and healthy capital markets allow companies to invest, spurring job creation and economic growth. Therefore, it is critical that our policymakers tailor regulations not just to ensure transparency and protect investors, but to do so without unnecessarily disrupting or constraining the role capital markets play in fostering economic growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though many of the Dodd-Frank reforms have made the U.S. financial system more resilient and less prone to shocks, they are not without cost,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We believe that appropriately tailored regulation should balance the dual goals of enhancing financial stability and investor protection while supporting the flow of investment capital to end-users who deploy that capital to create jobs and grow the economy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The testimony highlighted areas where review and recalibration are particularly warranted, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recalibrating&nbsp;<span>overall capital levels&nbsp;</span>and addressing&nbsp;<span>overlaps with capital and stress tests</span>. It is crucial that regulators take a holistic view on any forthcoming rulemakings and finalize them in conjunction with one another.</li>
<li>Regulators need to account for the&nbsp;<span>interactions &ndash; and overlaps &ndash; between the Global Market Shock &amp; the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book</span>.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li>It is crucial that greater credit be given for&nbsp;<span>diversification</span>&nbsp;in the FRTB to better align it with underlying risks and reward good risk management practices.</li>
<li>Any re-proposal should include revisions to facilitate banks&rsquo; ability to use&nbsp;<span>internal models</span>&nbsp;for market risk, given that internal models better reflect firms&rsquo; risk profiles.</li>
<li>OTC&nbsp;<span>derivatives</span>&nbsp;transactions with commercial end-users need to receive more favorable treatment in the final U.S. rule, in line with the approach taken by the EU.</li>
<li><span>Securitized products</span>&nbsp;provide significant economic benefits by lowering borrowing costs on a wide variety of consumer and business loans and help banks prudently manage their risks. The original Basel III Endgame proposal would have created perverse risk incentives that would have discouraged large banks from engaging in securitization activities.</li>
<li>More needs to be done to&nbsp;<span>conform with both the spirit and letter of the 2018 tailoring law</span>&nbsp;passed by Congress to ensure that enhanced prudential standards are proportionate to the size and risks posed by the U.S. operations of FBOs and regional banks.</li>
<li>Given that the post-crisis financial reforms have dramatically increased capital requirements for these banks and that a minimum floor is already included in the Basel III Endgame standards, the&nbsp;<span>Collins Amendment should be reexamined and reformed</span>. At a minimum, we recommend that U.S. Treasuries and central bank reserves be exempted from the Collins Amendment&rsquo;s floor on leverage calculations</li>
</ul>
<p>Several SEC rules finalized in the last administration under authorities conferred by Dodd-Frank should also be reviewed and revised:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>securities lending reporting</span>&nbsp;under Rule 10c-1a should be revised to clearly limit the scope of the rule to traditional securities lending arrangements and to otherwise coordinate any public disclosure with the short reporting rule to protect market participants who are short selling, should the rule survive a pending court challenge.</li>
<li>The SEC&rsquo;s&nbsp;<span>short selling rule</span>&nbsp;under Rule 13f-2 should be revised to significantly scale back the granularity of reporting obligations and to better coordinate with the sec lending reporting rule just discussed.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The U.S. financial system is significantly stronger and more resilient than it was before Dodd-Frank was passed in 2010. This is a good thing. However, SIFMA believes that it is now appropriate to evaluate whether certain components of the regulatory framework developed under mandates from the Dodd-Frank Act are excessively conservative and impose costs on the U.S. economy, our financial markets, and on Main Street that outweigh their benefits,&rdquo; Bentsen concluded in the testimony. &ldquo;We appreciate the Committee&rsquo;s interest in exploring these important questions on this fifteenth anniversary of Dodd-Frank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full testimony expands on these issues in more detail and can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/submissions/testimony/testimony-on-dodd-frank-turns-15-lessons-learned-and-the-road-ahead/">here</a>.</p>

<td class="body-text">
<p>Chairman Boozman, Ranking Member Klobuchar and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify about the regulation of digital commodities.<br /><br />I am President and CEO of FIA, the leading trade organization for the futures, options and cleared derivatives markets globally. Prior to FIA, I had the honor of working for this Committee during the passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act (CFMA) of 2000. I then went on to serve as a Commissioner and Acting Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for seven years, which included leading the agency during the financial crisis of 2008.<br /><br />My testimony today will focus on the strengths of the CFTC and its regulatory framework and offer the following recommendations for the Committee&rsquo;s consideration:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>FIA strongly supports Congress&rsquo; efforts to create a new regulatory framework for digital assets. This offers an opportunity for the US to regain leadership regarding this important innovation in markets technology.</li>
<li>We believe the CFTC is well-suited for the oversight of the digital commodity markets for five main reasons: principles-based regulations, an innovation-forward mission, robust customer protections, strong enforcement and an effective cross border framework.</li>
<li>We want to emphasize that futures commission merchants and the risk management expertise and financial resilience they bring to bear play an important role in fostering the growth and stability of the digital asset ecosystem.</li>
<li>We strongly support provisions included in the CLARITY Act that incentivize prudent risk management and hedging activity across digital asset and traditional markets through the recognition of risk offsets in the margin and capital framework.</li>
<li>Regulations to manage conflicts of interest when a single entity takes on multiple registration categories will be important to reduce risk and foster confidence in market integrity.</li>
</ul>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">The futures model for regulation</span><br /><br />Digital assets have come of age as an industry and are beginning to converge with traditional finance. Today, there are more than ten thousand types of blockchain-based<a href="https://email.fia.org/q/1th20AZCzCBaKjGqUhIZJy4f/wv#_ftn1">[1]</a>&nbsp;digital assets with a combined market capitalization of more than $3.4 trillion.<br /><br />The digital asset industry deserves and requires a proper regulatory framework that will keep these markets safe, innovative and growing. The US has an opportunity to lead in the global development of digital assets, but Congress must act quickly. Without this leadership, these markets will continue to expand overseas and outside of the reach of US influence.<br /><br />Already, the US has the largest equity and derivatives markets in the world, the globe&rsquo;s reserve currency and the most sophisticated and mature capital formation channels that span from angel investing to the public markets. The US should harness these strengths in building a best-in-class regulatory system for digital assets.<br /><br />Fortunately, we can leverage the expertise within America&rsquo;s existing regulatory framework and apply it to the new world of digital assets. And fortunately, the US has two strong markets regulators in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and CFTC that can collectively bring digital securities and digital commodities into a proper regulatory framework.<br /><br />Based on my depth of experience on the Commission and Capitol Hill, I believe the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC are well-suited for the oversight of the digital commodity markets, which will be my focus today.<br /><br />The CFTC&rsquo;s regulatory framework has several strengths I would like to highlight. These include principles-based regulations, an innovation-forward mission, robust customer protections, strong enforcement and an effective cross border framework.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Flexible legal framework</span><br /><br />First, I would like to highlight principles-based regulation. This outcomes-based regulatory framework allows regulators to tailor rules and guidance for new products like digital assets without hampering innovation.<br /><br />Congress enacted principles-based regulation as part of the CFMA in 2000, recognizing the value of this approach in helping the agency keep pace with technological advances and changing market dynamics.<br /><br />This flexible structure, in combination with the CEA&rsquo;s broad definition of commodities, has enabled the futures industry to grow significantly through the introduction of new and innovative products. Since the enactment of principles-based regulation twenty-five years ago, the trading volume of futures on US exchanges has risen from 491 million contracts in 2000 to 5.809 billion in 2024, an increase of more than 1000%.</td>

<p>Principles-based regulation has unlocked significant growth in our traditional markets and is a well-suited framework for the evolving marketplace of digital commodities.</p>
<p><img src="https://email.fia.org/i/amf_highroad_solution/project_2567/US_Futures_Volume_2000-2024_615w.png?size=0x0&amp;w=BI53TXEgQDGBZA5xauGNh7xWsOec" /><br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Innovation-forward mission</span><br /><br />The CFTC also benefits from having innovation directly in its agency mission, which explicitly requires the Commission to promote &ldquo;responsible innovation&rdquo; in fulfilling its core tenants of protecting customers and upholding the financial integrity of the marketplace. The CFTC has balanced these duties, without sacrificing the safety of the markets, throughout its fifty years of existence by nurturing the development of new asset classes like interest rate futures, energy contracts, volatility indices, emission allowances, over-the-counter swaps, and most recently, crypto futures products.<br /><br />The listing of&nbsp;<em>futures</em>&nbsp;on digital commodities has already provided the CFTC with significant experience regulating the cryptocurrency markets. In 2017, the CFTC first allowed exchanges to offer futures, options and swaps based on bitcoin. This decision brought these derivatives products into the CFTC regulatory framework for the first time. Since then, the range of products has expanded to include futures and options on Ether, Solana, Stellar, Avalanche, Hedera, Cardano and Ripple.<br /><br />Today, more than 60 cryptocurrency futures and options contracts trade on seven CFTC-registered exchanges. Collectively these contracts make up the world's largest fully regulated market for derivatives on cryptocurrencies and one of the primary institutional gateways to this new asset class.<br /><br />This experience, along with the CFTC&rsquo;s innovation-forward regulatory approach, positions the agency well for assuming more responsibility in the regulation of cash digital commodities.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robust customer protections</span><br /><br />Another area worth highlighting is the CFTC&rsquo;s customer protection regime, which has stood the test of time in protecting customer assets during various defaults in the futures markets. This regime consists of layers of protections around the segregation of customer funds. The CFTC requires that futures commission merchants (FCMs)&mdash;those brokers who serve as agents for customers&mdash;segregate, reconcile and confirm customer balances daily while providing a guaranty against shortfalls and losses should customers default.<br /><br />The regime adds another layer of protection by requiring FCMs to contribute to a &ldquo;rainy day&rdquo; default fund should a single FCM not be able to cover its losses. The protections also empower clearinghouses to port &ndash; or transfer &ndash; segregated customer funds from a failing FCM to a healthy one to maintain the functioning of the markets. I experienced this firsthand with the Lehman Brothers crisis and its resolution that I helped oversee during my time at the CFTC.<br /><br />These customer protections have held up as recently as the 2022 collapse of FTX, in which the only solvent part of that company was its CFTC-regulated derivatives clearing organization, LedgerX.<br /><br />The CFTC&rsquo;s customer protection regime would benefit the cash crypto markets and provide needed safeguards for end users should Congress provide this authority to the agency.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Strong enforcement</span><br /><br />It is also worth highlighting the CFTC&rsquo;s enforcement authorities that protect investors from fraud and manipulation and deter other market participants from wrongdoing. Over the years, the agency has used its enforcement authority effectively and aggressively.<br /><br />For example, the agency utilized its enforcement authority to pursue firms that attempted to rig the Libor interest rate benchmark. This led to scrutiny of benchmarks across a range of other markets, as well as a transition to more rigorous methodologies for price calculations to avoid this manipulative conduct.<br /><br />The CFTC has also used this enforcement authority to protect retail customers against highly-leveraged contracts based on currencies. The CFTC has effectively brought enforcement actions against those who prey on unsophisticated investors with get-rich-quick schemes. These actions have significantly reduced the amount of foreign currency fraud in our industry and deterred others from engaging in this corrupt activity.<br /><br />The CFTC has aggressively punished firms that have attempted to manipulate our energy markets. For example, during my time leading the CFTC, the agency charged several energy companies with attempting to manipulate prices for natural gas, sending strong deterrence signals to other energy firms in that space.<br /><br />Given this track record, I believe the CFTC would be an effective cop on the beat for this industry.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Effective cross border approach</span><br /><br />Lastly, I want to highlight the CFTC&rsquo;s approach to cross border trading, which has allowed customers access to global risk management products without endangering the integrity of U.S. markets.<br /><br />Futures markets have operated internationally for decades, with market participants in the U.S. accessing overseas markets for a wide range of commodity futures. With the global nature of commodity markets, the CFTC has developed a framework for allowing access if the overseas markets are subject to comparable regulation and supervision in their home countries.<br /><br />This framework has struck the right balance between protecting US entities and customers from fraud and manipulation while providing them with access to a wide range of markets around the world. As Congress considers regulating this new asset class, it should consider the benefits of this cross border approach, given the global nature of digital commodities.<br /><br />Beyond emphasizing these regulatory strengths, I would like to turn to specific stakeholder issues that would bring needed capacity and clarity for these new products.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The important role of futures commission merchants</span><br /><br />As you consider the various models for regulating digital commodity markets, we urge you to carefully weigh the important role of intermediaries.<br /><br />In the US futures markets, these are known as futures commission merchants, or FCMs. Under the futures model for regulation, they have a set of responsibilities critical to the integrity of futures markets.<br /><br />Those responsibilities include preventing misconduct by their customers and assisting regulators in maintaining orderly markets and preventing fraud, abuse and market manipulation.<br /><br />FCMs also are critically important to the financial stability of the clearing system as a whole. They provide the vast majority of the capital in the default funds maintained by the clearinghouses to absorb losses in case of a member default.<br /><br />As of the fourth quarter of 2024, FCMs contributed 98.4% of the $34.2 billion held by the top five US clearinghouses registered with the CFTC. Without this contribution from intermediaries, I question who would provide the buffer in the event of another FTX-style collapse.&nbsp;<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cross product margining and cross product netting</span><br /><br />The first issue involves the treatment of risk-reducing trades for margin and capital purposes. Like traditional markets, FIA supports digital securities supervised by the SEC and digital commodities supervised by the CFTC. These markets are highly interconnected; however, each agency has distinct margin and custody requirements for the products they regulate. Regulatory differences in margin regimes have complicated the ability to provide risk offsets that are usually available when one clearinghouse clears the same products.&nbsp;<br /><br />Providing margin offsets when offsetting transactions are risk-reducing incentivizes prudent risk management and hedging activity in both digital and traditional markets. It also allows for margin efficiencies for participants. We support statutory language that instructs the CFTC and SEC to allow for cross margining between offsetting positions in their markets.&nbsp;<br /><br />Additionally, we support legislative language that instructs prudential regulators to address their bank capital rules to recognize these offsetting risk positions through cross product netting. These related changes will bring important capacity to FCMs that provide client access to digital products and beyond, and it will help ensure the success of these markets.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Avoiding conflicts of interest</span><br /><br />Another area worth highlighting is the need for clear rules around managing the conflicts of interest that arise when a single entity takes on multiple registration categories.<br /><br />Traditionally, the CFTC has regulated its markets by functional registration category. Exchanges that bring together buyers and sellers must register as designated contract markets (DCMs). Clearinghouses, with their obligations to protect the financial integrity of the system, must register as designated clearing organizations (DCOs). Clearing members, those firms that guarantee and safeguard customer funds, must register as FCMs.<br /><br />Given these targeted responsibilities, registrants have historically been housed in independent legal entities. Increasingly, however, we see more entities creating a &ldquo;vertical stack.&rdquo; In other words, these entities are combining exchanges, clearinghouses, FCMs and trading arms all within the same legal structure.<br /><br />This is particularly true for entities in digital asset markets. In our May 2022&nbsp;<a href="https://email.fia.org/c/12QmdTwjyOVJnr5JH43cYWzTvzdCvU">comment letter</a>&nbsp;about the FTX US Derivatives application before the CFTC, FIA expressed concern that collapsing the existing multi-tiered ecosystem&mdash;with its inherent checks and balances and customer protections&mdash;could undo the strong foundation of the listed derivatives markets and, ultimately, put customers at risk.<br /><br />As such, we support legislative language that requires the CFTC to conduct a rulemaking on managing conflicts of interest when these various registration categories exist in the same firm. &nbsp;We believe the development of consistent rules around conflicts will ensure that customers are not faced with differing customer protections due to market structure design.<br /><br /><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Conclusion</span><br /><br />In closing, this committee has an opportunity to ensure these important markets continue to develop in a safe and innovative way &ndash; and one that protects customers and their funds.<br /><br />The time has come to enact a regulatory framework for digital assets that allow the US to lead in this asset class. I look forward to working with this committee on the best approach to reaching this important goal.<br /><br />Thank you for this opportunity to testify.</p>

<title>Expanding Financial Inclusion, Federal Reserve Governor Michael S. Barr, At "Unleashing A Financially Inclusive Future," The Second Annual Financial Inclusion Conference Hosted By The Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Eric; thank you to the Fed staff who have organized this second annual financial inclusion conference; and thank you all for being here.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a></p>
<p>I have long believed that financial inclusion is a crucial component of a safe and fair financial system. Working to improve financial inclusion has been an important part of my career, starting in 1995 when I joined the Treasury Department and worked with colleagues to build Community Development Financial Institutions, strengthen the Community Reinvestment Act, and launch the New Markets initiative. At the University of Michigan, financial inclusion was key to programs I worked on to support minority entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>With the support of both the public and private sectors, there have been many improvements and advancements in financial inclusion over the last three decades, evidenced by the decline in the rate of people who are unbanked and the increasing reach and success of programs such as the Bank On initiative that better meet the needs of low-income customers. I welcome this progress, but there is so much more to do to deepen and widen financial inclusion to many millions of people in America who could benefit from it. Better access to affordable financial services, geared to the needs of underserved families and entrepreneurs, can help them to build more secure lives, stronger communities, and a stronger American economy.</p>
<p>Financial inclusion contributes to the Federal Reserve's mission of promoting a healthy and growing economy and a safe and stable financial system. Consumers are two-thirds of economic activity, so access to credit for low-and-moderate income households and small businesses helps the economy to grow. In addition, the Fed has an important role in implementing a series of laws passed by Congress related to access to credit, such as the Community Reinvestment Act. As we learned during the Global Financial Crisis, household finances are crucial to a strong and stable financial system.</p>
<p>In my remarks today, I would like to go through several ways that the public and private sectors are helping to increase financial inclusion. Those efforts include greater access to bank accounts and financial services, faster payments services, responsible small-dollar lending methods, and the use of alternative data to promote credit access. These efforts have shown promise in expanding financial inclusion.</p>
<p><span>Bank Account Access Is the Foundation for Financial Inclusion</span><br />Financial inclusion begins with access to basic bank account services. While financial services are evolving rapidly&mdash;with new forms of financial intermediation, payment services, and even deposit-like money claims&mdash;it is still the case that access to a bank account is the foundation for helping families and businesses get the financial services they need. Bank accounts provide access to direct deposit and direct receipt of paychecks, benefit payments and tax refunds. Bank accounts provide connections to peer-to-peer payment systems, and for the vast majority of retail and wholesale payments. Bank accounts are also often the entry point for access to credit for households and businesses.</p>
<p>According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's 2023&nbsp;<em>National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households</em>, the number of Americans without bank accounts is at the lowest it has been since the survey began in 2009. Yet, there remain groups that struggle with low account access, including those who are disabled, those without a high school diploma, and minority groups, among others. Households that include someone of working age with a disability are three times as likely to be unbanked as working-age households without a disability. Meanwhile, Hispanic and African American households and American Indian and Alaskan Native households are five and six times as likely, respectively, to be unbanked as White households.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a>&nbsp;The unbanked cite account opening costs, unpredictable or high fees, and high minimum balance requirements as among the top reasons for not obtaining bank accounts.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a></p>
<p><span>Expansion of Banking Access</span><br />One private-sector program that has helped to address barriers to account access is the Bank On program, created by the Cities for Financial Empowerment Fund (CFEF) in 2006. Bank On is led by coalitions of regional financial institutions, community groups, and local governments working together to bring households into the financial system. CFEF certifies that Bank On accounts meet standards including low minimum deposits for account opening; low maintenance, overdraft, or other unexpected fees; and free branch ATM, online, and mobile banking (if offered).</p>
<p>Over 46,000 bank branches nationwide offer a certified Bank On account. An important way that the program has spread and taken root in communities is through the coalition model, which involves establishing relationships with local and state governments, public officials, and community organizations. These partners, engaged with and trusted by their communities, have helped overcome apprehension about bank accounts and helped drive the outreach needed for any business to find new customers. The Federal Reserve System has long been a partner of the Bank On Initiative. In 2006, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was a partner in creating the first coalition. At the St. Louis Fed, the publicly available Bank On National Data Hub (BOND) was created in 2017 to help identify the availability of certified accounts. Bank On coalitions across the country continue to partner on engagement, outreach, and data collection with their regional Reserve Banks. While Bank On is not the only way for banks to offer low-cost deposit accounts, the program is leading the effort for banks to offer safe and affordable bank accounts.</p>
<p><span>Faster Payments</span><br />Financial inclusion also requires timely access to funds. People living paycheck to paycheck incur the greatest costs of waiting for these funds. One of the primary benefits of a bank account over time is facilitating payments. Technological advances have driven improvement in this area, sometimes only incrementally, but the more recent advent of real-time payments&mdash;especially new services for instant or immediate payments&mdash;has the potential to make a big leap forward in service to households and businesses. Cash-strapped households and businesses need access to their funds right away, and they need reliable ways to pay expenses when they are due (and when they have the funds to pay them).</p>
<p>Low-income households may need quick access to make just-in-time transactions, such as same-day utility bill payment through their bank or to quickly receive funds from a family member to cover an emergency expense like an unanticipated car repair. While the benefits of getting instantaneous access to paychecks are obvious, the value of controlling precisely when and in what order payments settle may be less appreciated. With real-time payments, households and businesses can have better control over payment flows, helping them, for example, to avoid unexpected and unwelcome overdraft and nonsufficient funds fees.</p>
<p>Other countries are seeking methods to improve speed of payments. In India, for example, the implementation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), which is the country's digital instant funds transfer system, has allowed consumers to see some of these benefits in action. UPI is available for free on a customer's mobile device and can be used for merchant payments, bill payments, and money transfers, among other things. Since its implementation, the Reserve Bank of India has noted an increase in financial inclusion, particularly in rural areas where bank branch access is difficult.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>We have seen the benefits of technological advancement and innovation here in the U.S. as well. Today, technologies to improve the speed of payments are being implemented across platforms and products, providing consumers various ways to move money quickly and easily. The Federal Reserve, as a part of its mission to foster a safe, efficient, and widely accessible payments infrastructure, is playing a role as well. As we have in the past, and in collaboration with the private sector, we have worked to innovate the payment system using the latest technology to better meet the needs of businesses and households. In 2023, we launched the FedNow Service&reg;, an interbank payment system for banks and credit unions of all sizes to instantly and securely transfer money for their customers, any time of the day, on any day of the year.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;We are encouraged by innovative private-sector engagement with the new platform and instant payment services generally. We are already seeing the early users rolling out new services that can benefit consumers. One example is the ability for gig economy workers to gain instant access to earned wages, which can make a big difference in household cash flow management. We expect these types of innovations will continue to expand in the coming years and be delivered in new contexts, ultimately bringing broad benefits to liquidity-constrained consumers and small businesses that tightly manage payment inflows and outflows.</p>
<p><span>Small-Dollar Lending</span><br />Access to small-dollar loans from banks can help consumers smooth through the ups and downs of income and expenses. I think many people would be surprised how widely this help is needed. According to the Fed's 2024 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, when asked how they would respond if confronted with an unexpected $400 expense, 19 percent of adults said they would have paid at least in part by selling something; using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft; or would not be able to pay for the expense. When looking at households with incomes of under $25,000, this number increases to 46 percent.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a>&nbsp;Access to reasonably priced credit to cover these sorts of expenses is therefore a common need, especially among those with lower incomes.</p>
<p>In contrast to the more costly and riskier sources of credit that I mentioned, we are seeing bank-offered products that are helping to increase access to safer, lower-cost forms of small-dollar lending. The Fed and other bank regulators took a helpful step in this regard in 2020 by issuing guidance. According to that guidance, responsible small-dollar loan programs must treat customers fairly, have effectively managed risks, and be underwritten based on prudent policies. That means, first, that products are offered in a way that a high percentage of customers successfully repay their small-dollar loans in accordance with original loan terms, which is a key indicator of affordability, eligibility, and appropriate underwriting. Second, it means repayment terms, pricing, and safeguards minimize adverse customer outcomes, including cycles of debt due to rollovers or reborrowing. And finally, it means repayment outcomes and program structures enhance a borrower's financial capabilities by contributing positively to their record of servicing debts.</p>
<p>Most banks that have offered small-dollar loan products since 2020 follow these principles, and it has had a positive impact on the loan terms they offer. Loan terms have better matched customer needs and rates have come down. Small-dollar loans that have the potential to disrupt the market for costly alternative financial services are bank products that provide a straightforward application process, clear loan terms, certainty about approval, strong likelihood of repayment, and quick disbursement of funds.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/barr20250715a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a></p>
<p><span>Alternative Financial Data</span><br />Another channel for improving financial inclusion is the use of alternative financial data to supplement the traditional measures that banks have relied on to judge the creditworthiness of borrowers with limited or no traditional borrowing history. For example, lenders can evaluate cash flow&mdash;steady income and bill payments&mdash;as a measure of the likelihood of loan repayment. Alternative data can help lenders take a "second look" at consumers who would otherwise not qualify based on the more traditional credit-score-based underwriting models. In addition to making less expensive and more suitable loans available, alternative data often allows faster and sometimes near-instant loan decisions. This is an important consideration for low- and moderate-income borrowers, who tend to have little savings and struggle with meeting an unexpected expense. Technological advances such as application programming interfaces (APIs), a set of specifications that can allow software to communicate with each other, can also help lenders access permissioned consumer financial data that can be used for expedited underwriting and as the basis for online interfaces that allow for automated application, automated decisionmaking, and automatic fund delivery.</p>
<p>Let me conclude by circling back to where I started, which is the crucial role of access to safe, transparent, and low-cost bank accounts as the gateway to financial inclusion. We have made great progress, but I am certain that there are still many people whose finances and lives could improve with a bank account suited to their needs and economic circumstances but who feel locked out or discouraged from opening one. I applaud the work of financial inclusion leaders in doing what they can to make bank accounts available and better tailored to the needs of low- and moderate-income households. Responsibly using data and technology to better meet the financial needs of all Americans is an important aspect of this work.</p>
<p>In thinking about how to best design, market, and optimize the next generation of financial products and services, we can build on many years of behavioral financial research and practice and continue to improve access to credit for families and businesses. Thank you.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Consults On Proposed Process Refinements And Oversight For A Dispute Resolution Service For Investor Complaints</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-consults-on-proposed-process-refinements-and-2025715/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/canadian-securities-administrators-consults-on-proposed-process-refinements-and-2025715/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) has provided for comment more details on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/07/6236871-CSA-Notice-25-314-Proposed-Binding-Auth-Framework-for-Identified-Ombudservice.pdf">proposed framework for an independent dispute resolution service</a>&nbsp;with binding authority &ndash; anticipated to be the Ombudsman for Banking Services and Investments (OBSI). The consultation includes a proposed oversight model for OBSI and refinements on the review and decision stage of the dispute resolution process.</p>
<p>In light of the proposal to grant OBSI binding authority, the CSA is introducing an oversight framework that aims to balance OBSI&rsquo;s independence with the need for accountability.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Introducing binding authority for investment complaints is important to ensure investors have the ability to seek access to an impartial, fair and efficient dispute resolution process, and to give more certainty to businesses over the outcome of claims,&rdquo; said Stan Magidson, Chair of the CSA, and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission. &ldquo;The CSA&rsquo;s proposal will help modernize the structure of Canada&rsquo;s capital markets and simplify the complaints process for investors and businesses alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In response to comments received during the 2023 consultation, the CSA is also proposing changes to the second stage review of the dispute resolution process for OBSI compensation recommendations for $75,000 or more. For these complaints, OBSI will be required to appoint external decision makers to review its recommendation before reaching a final decision.</p>
<p>The comment period closes on September 15, 2025. Stakeholders are encouraged to submit their comments to the addresses in the notice and their&nbsp;<a href="http://www.asc.ca/">local securities regulator</a>. Implementation of a final framework is dependent on the governments of many CSA jurisdictions passing enabling legislation.</p>
<p>The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In November 2023, all members of the CSA published CSA Notice and Request for Comment &ndash; Registered Firm Requirements Pertaining to an Independent Dispute Resolution Service. CSA members other than the BC Securities Commission (BCSC) published for comment&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2023/11/6126447-CSA-Notice-Proposed-Amends-to-NI-31-103-OBSI.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">proposed amendments</a>&nbsp;to certain complaint-handling provisions of NI 31-103 Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, as well as proposed changes to Companion Policy 31-103CP Registration Requirements, Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations, which would form part of the proposed framework in those jurisdictions. While the BCSC did not participate in the publication of proposed amendments, it supports the outcomes intended by this project. British Columbia is considering legislative changes that may achieve the same outcomes as those intended by the proposals. The BCSC is interested in feedback about the oversight framework, the proposed refinements, and OBSI&rsquo;s limitation period, and will take comments into consideration.</li>
<li>The CSA received comments about OBSI&rsquo;s six-year limitation period, given that some jurisdictions have a two-year limitation period. Commenters provided a range of views around time limits. The CSA is not proposing to change OBSI&rsquo;s six-year limitation period at this time. This consultation provides additional background about OBSI&rsquo;s limitation period and invites comments about it.</li>
<li>In Qu&eacute;bec, the Autorit&eacute; des march&eacute;s financiers (AMF) is participating in the CSA consultation by proposing to maintain the exemption applicable to firms registered in Qu&eacute;bec regarding dispute resolution services requirements.

<title>CalPERS Announces New Pharmacy Benefits Contract With CVS Caremark To Foster Affordability And Improve Quality - New Agreement Aims To Address Rising Prescription Drug Costs While Improving Quality For CalPERS Members</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CalPERS announced a new pharmacy benefits contract with CVS Caremark (CVS) today that is designed to address rising costs of prescriptions while ensuring access to safe and effective medications for members. The five-year contract includes new financial terms with CVS putting $250 million at-risk over the term of the contract for controlling drug costs and improving the health of CalPERS members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This new contract reflects CalPERS&rsquo; ongoing commitment to affordability and quality for our members,&rdquo; said Ram&oacute;n Rubalcava, chair of the CalPERS Board of Administration Pension and Health Benefits Committee. &ldquo;By putting CalPERS&rsquo; values in the driver&rsquo;s seat, we&rsquo;re ensuring that our members and their families have access to the medications and support they need to manage their health.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>What This Means for CalPERS Members</span></p>
<p>The contract with CVS will provide outpatient prescription drug benefits for approximately 587,000 members enrolled in Basic or Medicare HMO and PPO plans. This represents about 40% of the 1.5 million members who receive health care benefits through CalPERS.</p>
<p>CalPERS agreed to contract with CVS Caremark instead of other vendors because of its demonstrated ability to deliver more affordable drug benefits and its commitment to performance guarantees in key areas such as managing pharmacy cost trends and ensuring clinical quality. The contract also provides for increased transparency, audit, and oversight provisions throughout the five years of the contract. CVS will begin providing benefits for CalPERS members starting on January 1, 2026, replacing OptumRx.</p>
<p>Important facts that members need to know with this new contract include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most CalPERS members will continue to fill their same prescriptions at the same pharmacy they use currently.</li>
<li>The new contract will result in some formulary changes that may impact copays for some Basic and Medicare members or involve a change in medication to an equally effective alternative. Together with CVS, CalPERS will develop a range of options for our members to navigate any change and ensure medications are available when and where they&rsquo;re needed.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2>Performance Guarantees to Drive Accountability</h2>
<p>A cornerstone of the new five-year agreement is the inclusion of performance guarantees that hold CVS accountable for meeting cost and quality targets. The new contract requires CVS to put $250 million at-risk if they do not meet goals for controlling pharmacy benefit costs and ensuring clinical quality outcomes for our members. The clinical guarantees that apply to both Basic and Medicare HMO and PPO plans align with two clinical measures in CalPERS&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/calpers-driving-improvements-in-healthcare-quality-alignment-measure-set-and-incentives">Quality Alignment Measure Set</a>&nbsp;for improving care for high blood pressure and diabetes.</p>
<p>The cost trend guarantees help ensure financial predictability over the course of the contract and provide additional sustainability to our overall health program. Taken together, these performance guarantees represent groundbreaking improvements by aligning CVS&rsquo; financial interests with CalPERS&rsquo; concerns for quality and financial affordability that have generally been lacking in the pharmacy benefits industry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By holding the PBM accountable for delivering results, we&rsquo;re aligning their interests with those of our members and their public sector employers,&rdquo; said Don Moulds, CalPERS Chief Health Director. &ldquo;This contract is designed to ensure that every dollar spent on prescription drugs delivers value for our members and ensures the sustainability of our program.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A Model for Innovation</h2>
<p>The new PBM contract builds on CalPERS&rsquo; broader efforts to align health care affordability with quality and equity. By aligning these pharmacy benefits with our overall health care goals, CalPERS aims to create a model that can serve as a blueprint for purchasers across the nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This agreement represents a significant step forward in addressing one of the most pressing challenges in health care today &mdash; the rising cost of prescription drugs,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Julia Logan. &ldquo;CalPERS is demonstrating that it&rsquo;s possible to achieve affordability, quality, and transparency through terms that put our members&rsquo; and our public employers&rsquo; interests at the forefront of this multi-year arrangement with CVS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CalPERS officials also expressed gratitude to leaders and teams at OptumRx. &ldquo;We thank OptumRx for providing pharmacy benefits to our members over the past nine years,&rdquo; Moulds said. &ldquo;We look forward to building on that foundation with CVS to deliver continued value and service across PPO and HMO plans.&rdquo;</p>

<title>CalPERS Announces Health Plan Premiums For 2026</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-announces-health-plan-premiums-for-2026-2025715/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-announces-health-plan-premiums-for-2026-2025715/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The CalPERS Board of Administration approved health plan premiums for the calendar year 2026 today, with an overall weighted premium rate increase of 8.21%.</p>
<p>The rate increase for Basic (non-Medicare) plans will average 7.76%. Members enrolled in CalPERS' Basic Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans will have an average premium rate increase of 6.48%. Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Basic plans will have an overall rate increase of 12.08%. Medicare plan premiums will see an average increase of 10.78% overall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continued rise in costs across the health care landscape remains a significant challenge for purchasers such as CalPERS, but we remain committed to meeting this challenge by providing access to high-quality, equitable care that improves health outcomes while pursuing innovative strategies to manage costs,&rdquo; said Ram&oacute;n Rubalcava, chair of the Pension and Health Benefits Committee.</p>
<p>Pharmacy costs continue to drive rate changes across plans as utilization and unit costs increase, particularly with specialty and brand name drugs. For Medicare premiums, revenue changes from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and increased utilization of medical services further impact costs for both Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplemental plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Each year, we carefully evaluate our plans to ensure they offer high-value care that improves health outcomes, emphasizes prevention, and effectively manages costs,&rdquo; said CalPERS Chief Health Director Don Moulds. &ldquo;We know that premium increases can be a challenge, and Open Enrollment is a chance for members to review their benefits and select a plan that supports their health and budget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CalPERS will also be replacing Blue Shield&rsquo;s Trio plan with Access+ HMO in Monterey County to help ensure the viability of lower cost health plan options for our membership in the face of significant regional price variation. In addition, members in the PERS Gold PPO plan can continue to receive in-patient deductible credits of up to $500 for completing an expanded menu of preventive care activities including cancer and depression screenings, vaccinations, among others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following tables represent the overall percentage premium change for each health plan between 2025 and 2026 using the state, single-party premium.</p>

<p>Richard Purssell (Insight Investments) and Oliver Brennan (BNP Paribas) presented an update on recent market developments.</p>
<p>Mr Purssell outlined how G10 currencies had performed over the last three years and noted that G10 spot spreads had moved in tandem with recent market volatility. Mr Brennan discussed the economic and geopolitical factors impacting the US dollar and British pound and highlighted yield differentials and tariff risk as key drivers of FX movements.</p>
<p>The Committee discussed the increased volatility across currency pairs and how this had been interpreted by different market participants. There was a general consensus that although volatility had been elevated, FX liquidity and market functioning remained robust.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Item 4 &ndash; FXJSC Turnover Survey &ndash; October 2024 Results</h3>
<p>Muna Lisimba (Bank of England) gave an overview of the October 2024 FXJSC Turnover Survey results. Mr Lisimba noted that average daily turnover for the 6 months to October was $3,217bn, representing a 5% decline from the preceding April 2024 survey.

</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Item 5 &ndash; FX Settlement Risk Mitigation</h3>
<p>Natalie Lovell (Bank of England) noted that the Bank of England would apply on behalf of the FXJSC to have the December 2024 version of the FX Global Code formally&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-regulate/recognised-industry-codes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>recognised by</span><span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/about/how-we-regulate/recognised-industry-codes" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><span>the FCA</span><span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external"></span></a>.</p>
<p>Ms Lovell provided a high-level overview of the October 2024 GFXC FX Settlement Risk Survey results. Ms Lovell added that the April 2025 GFXC FX Settlement Risk Survey would run alongside the BIS Triennial Survey, and both surveys would use consistent reporting methodology.</p>
<p>Ms Lovell explained that during 2025 the GFXC FX Settlement Risk Working Group would focus on analysing the results of the GFXC and BIS Triennial FX settlement risk surveys. The Working Group would also consider producing a discussion paper on the potential impact of the UK/EU move to T+1 securities settlement on the FX market.</p>

Ms Saporta also noted that effective 13 November 2024 the WM/R 4pm benchmark (the Fix) had been designated as critical under the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) UK Benchmark Regulation.</p>
<p>Sarah Collins (UBS Asset Management) and Kate Hill (Aviva Investors) gave an overview of the Fix and how its use had evolved over time. It was noted that the Fix was used as a benchmark rate by a broad range of market participants. By trading close to, or at the Fix, participants could minimise tracking erro<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/minutes/2024/march/fxjsc-main-committee-meeting-13-march-2025#_bookmark0">r1</a>&nbsp;and FX risk. The Fix could also be used to calculate global indices, value assets, and track performance.</p>
<p>There had been a notable increase in flow around the Fix, in particular at month/quarter-end. The Committee discussed the potential impacts of the Fix on market functioning and how those impacts could be exacerbated in a stress. There was a range of views on the benefits of the Fix to end users. Committee members also discussed the challenges of moving away from the Fix given that many client mandates dictate its use.</p>

<p>Mr Kemp also noted ongoing work by GFXD to further understand why certain FX trades are settled on a gross bilateral basis. This will feed into the GFXC work on this topic.</p>

<title>Authority For Anti-Money Laundering And Countering The Financing Of Terrorism Expects High Standards Against Financial Crime In Crypto Sector</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/authority-for-anti-money-laundering-and-countering-the-financing-of-terrorism-ex-2025715/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>With the launch of its powers and responsibilities on 1 July 2025, AMLA expects firms engaging in crypto asset activities to have in place strong protections against money laundering and terrorist financing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em>&ldquo;We welcome the development of new technologies and business models. However, it is essential that in the light of a new regulatory framework and major transformation of the crypto-assets sector, Europe is adequately protected from the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing stemming from this sector.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;said&nbsp;<span>Bruna Szego</span>, Chair of AMLA. The Authority will work closely with other European authorities and the National Competent Authorities (NCAs) to coordinate actions to ensure effective outcomes. Crypto-asset service providers (CASPs) and their supervision are therefore featuring prominently in AMLA&rsquo;s recently published Work Programme for 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<p>AMLA recognizes that CASPs are exposed to significant money laundering and terrorist financing (ML/TF) risks due to their technological features, cross-border operations, and anonymity-enhancing capabilities. The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) is now in effect and requires CASPs to get a MiCA licence to provide their services in the EU. Several authorisations have already been issued including for some of the larger crypto companies. AMLA expects that the number of licenced CASPs will continue to increase considerably.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In its recently published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amla.europa.eu/document/download/b78bee2f-16b9-4742-a3a1-23e7aad394ab_en?filename=AMLA_Work_Programme_July%202025_0.pdf">Work Programme 2025</a>, AMLA has announced the strategic objective to prevent ML/TF threats and to promote a level playing field across the EU, including for crypto-asset service sector. Following the risk-based approach, AMLA places a strong emphasis on CASPS providing services across the EU to implement anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards consistently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to MICA and the European AML Framework the initial licensing and supervision of CASPs remain under the remit of national competent authorities (NCAs). There is a risk of diverging application of AML/CFT requirements and inconsistent controls. As part of its role in indirect supervision of the financial sector, AMLA expects licencing and supervisory authorities to ensure that CASPs have effective AML/CFT systems in place from day one of their authorisation. &nbsp;<br />By working closely with national supervisors and European authorities, AMLA will develop plans to promote high standards of AML/CFT controls to reach that goal. In parallel, AMLA&rsquo;s financial intelligence pillar will reflect this priority by including crypto-asset related financial intelligence within the initial areas proposed for joint analyses, targeting cross-border typologies and emerging risks in this fast-evolving domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) will escalate the market surveillance measure imposed on securities of DV8 pcl (DV8) from level 1 to level 2, from July 16, 2025 to August 5, 2025. In addition to restrictions currently imposed under Level 1, trading of DV8 securities will be limited to auction matching method during the specified period. Order submissions are allowed only during pre-open 1, pre-open 2, and pre-close sessions, with random auction matching conducted at three designated intervals as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="SET_15Jul25" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/SET_15Jul25.jpg" title="SET_15Jul25" /></p>
<p>DV8 securities have been subject to level 1 of market surveillance measures since May 21, 2025 following the unusual change in trading momentum without substantiated fundamentals or information. During the enforcement period of these initial measures, DV8 securities experienced a significant reduction in daily trading volume by 5 million shares on average, while prices continued to increase.</p>
<p>Today (July 15, 2025), DV8 exhibited sharp surges in both trading volume and prices, closing at a new high of THB 8.60 (+21.13%) with 18 million shares traded despite the company&rsquo;s negative price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book value ratio of 15.4 times. DV8's market capitalization increased from THB 700 million to THB 11.36 billion over a three-month period. Additionally, on July 3, 2025 and July 11, 2025, the company disclosed information regarding a conditional tender offer priced at THB 0.56 per share which was substantially below the market prices, with a potential cancellation if fewer than 990 million shares are tendered and a statement that the tender offeror planned to expand digital asset business pending completion of a feasibility study by the fourth quarter of 2025. Therefore, SET has decided to escalate the market surveillance measures imposed on DV8 to level 2 from July 16, 2025 to August 5, 2025. Investors are strongly encouraged to conduct comprehensive fundamental analysis and rely exclusively on reliable information prior to undertaking any investment decisions.</p>
<p>Remark: Market surveillance measures for implementation by member companies:</p>
<p>Level 1: Exclusion from credit limit calculation, and cash balance requirement (100 percent cash payment).</p>
<p>Level 2: Prohibition of net settlement, exclusion from credit limit calculation, cash balance requirement, and auction matching method only.</p>
<p>Level 3: One-day trading suspension on the first trading day, prohibition of net settlement following trading permission, exclusion from credit limit calculation, cash balance requirement, and auction matching method only.</p>

<title>Welcoming Remarks, Federal Reserve Vice Chair For Supervision Michelle W. Bowman, At "Unleashing A Financially Inclusive Future," The Second Annual Financial Inclusion Conference Hosted By The Federal Reserve Board, Washington, D.C. (Via Prerecorded Video)</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Good morning. I'm very pleased to welcome you to the second annual Financial Inclusion Conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Board.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250715a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;Last year, at our inaugural event, I underscored that financial inclusion is essential for creating an economy that works for everyone, with innovation in the financial sector playing an important role.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250715a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>This year's conference builds upon increased engagement across both the public and private sectors, with a collective effort to leverage technology to broaden financial service access and improve the financial well-being of consumers and small businesses. The Federal Reserve will continue to play an important role in these efforts through its research, community engagement, and regulatory approach. This work supports our ability to understand and communicate the state of financial inclusion, how banks support access to affordable financial services, and the role that our policies and practices play in promoting inclusion.</p>
<p><span>Progress to Date</span><br />Banks of all sizes are working to improve access to financial services for all Americans. As I've noted in the past, the U.S. banking system is well-positioned to bring consumers and small businesses into the financial mainstream by providing access to safe, fair, and responsive financial products and services.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250715a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;These efforts greatly benefit from our continued focus on broader access and innovation, including understanding how our supervisory and regulatory framework either supports or impairs a bank's ability to provide affordable financial services that are consistent with safety and soundness.</p>
<p>Innovation comes in many forms. One example is through banks' use of alternative data, which can enable banks to provide services like affordable small-dollar loans or to provide access to credit invisibles who may not have access to loans and other financial services from traditional lenders.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250715a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a>&nbsp;This growing area of focus also helps align financial service offerings with a customer's financial goals.</p>
<p>A well-functioning financial system provides a foundation for strong consumer financial health. To further this, the federal banking agencies recently published a request for information on check and payments fraud to help address the impact of this growing problem on banks and their customers. I am committed to working together with a wide range of state and federal partners, including law enforcement, to address this issue.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bowman20250715a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a></p>
<p><span>A More Financially Inclusive Future</span><br />Although there has been significant progress in providing access to financial services, there is more work left to be done. We know that financial institutions, both small and large, are working to build innovative approaches to meet their customers' needs while maintaining the safety and soundness of the banking system.</p>
<p><span>Today's Conference</span><br />The theme of this year's conference is "Unleashing a Financially Inclusive Future." Today, we will hear from a number of experts that will help to explore what the future might hold for financial inclusion. Our next presenter, Jo Ann Barefoot from the Alliance for Innovative Regulation, will discuss the role of banking industry innovation and policies in support of financial inclusion. Later in the day we will hear from three panels focused on topics including evolving products and practices, the role of mission-driven organizations, and how cross-border payment innovations can facilitate the movement of money around the world.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you all for joining us today and I will turn it over to Art Lindo, Deputy Director and Head of Policy in the Board's Division of Supervision &amp; Regulation, to introduce Jo Ann Barefoot.</p>
<p>Thank you for the opportunity to join you virtually today, and for your ongoing commitment to support a financially inclusive future.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://biocatch.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">BioCatch</a>, which prevents financial crime by recognizing patterns in human behavior, posted its best second quarter in company history in Q2 of 2025, exceeding $160 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR) following a 2024 in which the company set a fiscal-year record for new sales (more than $40 million). As of the end of June, BioCatch&rsquo;s total global customer roster surpassed 280 financial institutions in more than 20 different countries.</p>
<p>BioCatch onboarded more than 20 new customers in the second quarter of 2025, including one of the largest banks in the U.S. Over the same period, the company&rsquo;s North America business surpassed $50 million in ARR and now counts three of the four largest U.S. banks as customers.</p>
<p>BioCatch also continued to make significant progress with its most strategic products. The company followed up last November&rsquo;s launch of BioCatch Trust&trade; Australia &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first inter-bank, behavior-based, real-time intelligence-sharing network &ndash; with the May debut of BioCatch Trust&trade; Argentina. This network-driven approach enables customers to protect consumers against a broad set of difficult-to-detect scam typologies.</p>
<p>ARR through BioCatch partners surpassed $10 million in Q2, growing 71% from the year prior. BioCatch&rsquo;s voice scams and money mules solutions now account for 15% of the company&rsquo;s total ARR &ndash; up from just 5% of ARR two years prior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could not have done any of this without the partnership of our customers in more than 20 countries around the world,&rdquo; BioCatch CEO Gadi Mazor said. &ldquo;Together, we have not only the unique ability but also a duty to advance the global fight against fraud and financial crime. The world&rsquo;s leading financial institutions continue to improve their defensive postures while also taking this fight to the fraudsters, adopting offensive, pre-transaction capabilities. In the second half of this year, we plan to build upon the successes of the first half, accelerating our technological innovation, expanding our global footprint, facilitating cross-border collaboration, and setting new standards in scale and detection to make banking safer every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>BioCatch now analyzes more than 15 billion user sessions per month, protecting more than 525 million people on more than 1.6 billion devices from fraud and financial crime, while stopping an estimated $3.7 billion in fraudulent transactions in 2024. The company&rsquo;s Net Promoter Score (NPS) sits at a world-class 72. BioCatch also received&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/online-fraud-detection/vendor/biocatch" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">20 Gartner Peer Insights</a>&nbsp;reviews in 2024 with an average rating of 4.95 (with 5 being &ldquo;excellent&rdquo;).</p>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/new-incoming-ceo-of-the-uk-national-wealth-fund-2025715/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has today announced the appointment of Oliver Holbourn as the new Chief Executive Officer of the National Wealth Fund, to lead it through its next chapter.</p>
<p>Oliver brings more than 25 years of experience across banking, strategy, and public financial investments including CEO roles at RBS International and, formerly, UK Financial Investments.</p>
<p>The National Wealth Fund is the government&rsquo;s principal investor and policy bank. It is at the forefront of investing public money and mobilising private capital to help deliver on the government&rsquo;s growth and clean energy missions.</p>
<p>Since its launch in October 2024, the National Wealth Fund has committed &pound;2.5 billion, supporting 10,700 jobs. It also has expanded firepower, with &pound;5.8 billion of additional capital to deploy. The NWF&rsquo;s economic capital limit has been increased allowing it to take on greater risk, providing greater flexibility over its investments to support more projects to access private finance.</p>
<p>The Chancellor recently set this government&rsquo;s Strategic Priorities for the National Wealth Fund over this Parliament.&nbsp;Under Oliver Holbourn&rsquo;s leadership, the National Wealth Fund will enter a new phase of delivering these priorities: significantly increasing the amount of capital it deploys; expanding into new sectors; and trialling Strategic Partnerships with Mayoral Strategic Authorities to develop richer pipelines for regional investment.</p>
<p>This appointment followed a fair and open recruitment process, and he is expected to take up his post on 1 November.</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to congratulate Oliver on his appointment as CEO of the National Wealth Fund.</p>
<p>Oliver brings a wealth of private sector expertise and public service experience to this critical role. His expertise will be instrumental in delivering the government&rsquo;s growth and clean energy missions.</p>
<p class="last-child">I would like to thank John Flint for his leadership in successfully transforming the UK Infrastructure Bank into the National Wealth Fund and for laying a strong foundation for its future growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Incoming CEO of the National Wealth Fund, Oliver Holbourn said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The National Wealth Fund has an important role to play in the economic success of the UK; so I am deeply honoured to be taking the reins as Chief Executive at such a pivotal time.</p>
<p class="last-child">I am excited to get to work &ndash; using the NWF&rsquo;s expertise and resources to partner with businesses, investors, mayoral combined and local authorities, and ministers and stakeholders to mobilise private investment alongside public sector finance. This will help drive sustainable economic growth across the UK and support the clean energy transition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chair of the National Wealth Fund, Chris Grigg said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oliver is the ideal person to lead the Fund into our next phase. He is passionately committed to our mission, brings a rare combination of senior leadership across both the public and private sectors, and has a background in banking, which is at the heart of what we do.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">I look forward to working with Oliver to realise the full potential of our expanded mandate, delivering the Government&rsquo;s ambitions for growth and clean energy, underpinned by the new Industrial Strategy.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="biography">Biography</h4>
<p>Oliver Holbourn was until very recently the CEO of RBS International Holdings, a subsidiary of the NatWest Group, where he was on the Group Executive Committee for over four years.</p>
<p>With over 25 years of experience across investment banking, government investments, and strategic leadership. Oliver brings deep expertise in managing capital to deliver public value having previously served as Chief Executive Officer of UK Financial Investments (UKFI), where he was responsible for managing the government&rsquo;s shareholdings in RBS, Lloyds and UK Asset Resolution, overseeing complex, high-value shareholdings on behalf of the UK taxpayer.</p>
<p>Earlier in his career, Oliver spent over a decade at Bank of America, latterly as Managing Director of Equity Capital Markets for the UK, Ireland, and South Africa. His career has been defined by a strong track record in financial leadership, capital markets, and public sector engagement.</p>

<title>Islamic Fintech Offa Launches Ultra-Fast And Easy Bridge-To-Let Finance - Modern, Tech-Led Product Disrupts Traditionally Cumbersome Islamic Finance Sector</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Offa, the UK&rsquo;s leading Islamic property finance fintech, has today launched an innovative bridge-to-let finance service &ndash; combining Offa&rsquo;s ultra-fast bridge product with its modern, paperless buy-to-let (BTL).</span></p>
<p><span>Offa, which was the first to introduce Sharia-compliant bridge finance to the UK, is on a mission to disrupt and transform the traditionally old-fashioned and cumbersome world of Islamic finance through flexible, faith-based property finance solutions and digital processes, making it fast and easy to apply and get funding.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Sagheer Malik, Offa&rsquo;s Group Chief Commercial Officer</span>&nbsp;and MD&nbsp;<span>of Retail Finance, said: &ldquo;Speed is the crucial factor in real estate. Our ultra-quick bridge-to-let service is the first of its kind in this sector, allowing both Muslims and non-Muslims to save huge amounts of money, unlocking equity and providing wealth for their families. We are now offering faith-based finance products that not only out-perform those of our competitors in Islamic finance but also those in conventional finance.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Acquiring bridge and BTL finance separately can take many months, but by combining both simultaneously, Offa&rsquo;s Sharia-compliant bridge-to-let can provide finance within weeks instead of months, depending on credit rating and risk criteria. This allows aspiring landlords or seasoned property investors to buy and upgrade below-value properties, releasing equity.</span></p>
<p><span>Customers avoid double-application fees for bridge and BTL, paying a flat &pound;495 bridge-to-let fee instead, and they save 0.5% on BTL arrangement fees. There is no minimum term on the bridge product, providing flexibility, and if a buyer&rsquo;s rental income is not sufficient for BTL finance, they can make up the difference with their personal monthly income (commonly known in the industry as top-slicing).</span></p>
<p><span><span>Naseer Ahmed, Offa&rsquo;s&nbsp;</span>Managing Director&nbsp;<span>of Bridge Finance, said: &ldquo;By combining our teams&rsquo; decades of industry experience with the latest technology, we at Offa are on a mission to bring Islamic finance into the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaving behind the onerous paperwork and cumbersome systems that many customers have typically had to suffer in the past.&rdquo;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Instead of using interest, Offa&rsquo;s BTL product involves the Islamic finance principles of co-ownership-with-leasing. Customers acquire the property in partnership with Offa and make monthly payments to increase their share, over time owning it.</span></p>
<p><span>The service is available to anyone purchasing property in England and Wales aged 18 or over, with a minimum income of &pound;18,000 per annum, and with a minimum property value of &pound;80,000.</span></p>
<p><span>Offa recently purchased Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s Alburaq Sharia-compliant home finance portfolio in a landmark deal, and also announced it had received FCA authorisation to provide Islamic home purchase plans. The company received &pound;230 million of sharia-compliant funding for its BTL product, offering significant capacity for the business to expand and diversify its financial propositions in the UK property market.</span></p>
<p><span>Offa follows an ethical finance model designed in accordance with Islamic finance principles, which means not charging interest and not investing in sectors deemed harmful to society &ndash; such as alcohol, tobacco, animal testing, gambling and the arms trade.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The second quarter of 2025 concluded on a positive note, despite beginning with uncertainties around trade, tariffs, and legislation. Key drivers of growth included progress in global trade negotiations, easing inflation, and new U.S. tax and spending legislation. Markets rallied in June as optimistic growth forecasts and declining interest rates offset lingering geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>The FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index closed June at a record high of 100,658.12 points, marking a 0.8% increase from its May 2025 value of 99,872.61. This strong performance reflects an 8.9% rise in Q2 2025, building on a 12.6% gain in Q1 2025 and contrasting with a 2.9% decline in Q2 2024.</p>

<p>The Financial Market Infrastructure Committee (FMIC) has responsibility within the Bank for exercising the Bank&rsquo;s FMI functions as set out in the Bank of England Act 1998.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BoE Act 1998 requires the Treasury, at least once in each Parliament, to make recommendations to the FMIC about aspects of the government&rsquo;s economic policy to which the Bank should have regard when considering how to advance its objectives and the application of its regulatory principles. This letter provides such recommendations and outlines the important role that the Bank plays in protecting financial stability, facilitating innovation, and supporting the government&rsquo;s growth mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The FMIC is required to respond to the recommendations from the Treasury within a year of receiving the recommendations, and each subsequent year after that. These responses set out action that the FMIC has taken, or intends to take, in accordance with the recommendations, or why it has not acted.</p>

<p>In the first phase of reforms, the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) propose to streamline the Senior Managers &amp; Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR).</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>In the first phase of reforms, the FCA and Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) propose to streamline the Senior Managers &amp; Certification Regime (SM&amp;CR).</p>
<p>The changes will make the regime more effective and efficient and drive growth in financial services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the government consults on legislative changes to the regime &ndash; including removing the Certification Regime and increasing flexibility for the regulators to reduce the number of senior management functions (SMFs) which require pre-approval &ndash; the regulators&rsquo; proposals aim to make the regime less onerous on firms, while continuing to protect consumers and markets, and the safety and soundness of firms.</p>
<p>The consultations, which have been informed by the regulators&rsquo; 2023 Discussion Paper, includes proposals to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Give firms more time and flexibility to submit applications for approving new senior managers when there has been an unexpected or temporary change.</li>
<li>Strip out duplication where the same individuals are certified for separate functions, which would reduce the number of certification roles by 15%.</li>
<li>Provide guidance on how to streamline the annual checks firms need to undertake to certify individuals are &lsquo;fit and proper&rsquo; to do their role.</li>
<li>Allow more time for firms to report updates to senior manager responsibilities.</li>
<li>Increase how long criminal record checks for senior manager applications are valid for, prior to application submission.</li>
<li>Help firms to better understand the definition of certain SMF roles.</li>
<li>Give firms more time to update the directory, which lists certified staff.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>The SM&amp;CR holds individual senior managers in financial firms accountable for their conduct and competence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, FCA chief executive, said:&nbsp;<br /><br />&lsquo;Integrity and accountability at the top matter, which is why there is widespread support for the Senior Managers and Certification Regime. We are proposing streamlining the rules, so they work better for industry and support competitiveness and our approach to outcomes-based regulation, while maintaining the high standards the regime has set.&rsquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Woods, chief executive of the PRA and deputy governor for prudential regulation at the Bank of England, said: &nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;High standards of accountability are important for maintaining confidence in our financial services industry. Today&rsquo;s changes will reduce the burden of the Senior Managers and Certification Regime without diluting accountability, and we will work with the government on further reforms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This consultation will close on 7 October 2025.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ul>
<li>The SM&amp;CR ensures accountability among senior managers within financial services firms and maintains standards of behaviour and competence across the board.</li>

<li>HM Treasury has also launched a consultation to support a further phase in which the regulators would be able to make additional changes if legislation is made. This could include developing a more proportionate replacement for the Certification Regime; significantly reducing the number of roles requiring regulatory pre-approval; and further streamlining the assessment process.&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-reforming-the-senior-managers-certification-regime" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Reforming the Senior Managers &amp; Certification Regime | GOV.Uk (opens in a new window)">Read HM Treasury&rsquo;s consultation paper<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext"></span></a>.</li>

<title>Leeds Reforms To Rewire Financial System, Boost Investment And Create Skilled Jobs Across UK - Red Tape Cut And Savers Supported To Invest As Chancellor Rewires Financial System To Boost Growth</title>

<div class="call-to-action">
<ul>
<li> Leeds Reforms will make the UK the number one destination for financial services businesses by 2035, attracting inward investment and creating good skilled jobs across the UK through the Plan for Change.&nbsp; </li>
<li> Rachel Reeves promises to &ldquo;double down on the UK&rsquo;s global strengths&rdquo; as she unveils first-ever Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness sector plan, a key plank of the modern Industrial Strategy. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Working people will be equipped with the support they need to invest and grow their savings, under plans to rewire the financial system to attract investment, create good skilled jobs across the country and put more money into people&rsquo;s pockets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Banks will send investment opportunities to savers with cash sitting in low-interest accounts for the first time, and major financial institutions &ndash; including high street banks - are backing an advertising campaign that will highlight the opportunities of investing for consumers who are able to do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under current trends, moving &pound;2,000 from these accounts to stocks and shares could make millions of people over &pound;9,000 better off in 20 years&rsquo; time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plans to boost people&rsquo;s savings and the economy were unveiled by the Chancellor at a summit of top finance executives in Leeds today as she set out the widest ranging reforms to financial regulation in over a decade - backing one of the key eight growth driving sectors of the future identified in the Government&rsquo;s modern Industrial Strategy published last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Chancellor told executives that, having delivered stability and a sustainable strategy for investment, it was time for the UK to &ldquo;double down on its global strengths&rdquo; through reform to make sure it stays ahead in the global race for business investment and the good skilled jobs they bring.</p>
<p><strong>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rachel Reeves said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We fixed the public finances and stabilised the economy. Now we need to double down on our global strengths to put the UK ahead in the global race for financial businesses - creating good skilled jobs in every part of the country and helping savers&rsquo; money go further through our Plan for Change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Business Secretary, Jonathan Reynolds said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial Services are a UK success story, and one of the eight sectors we identified with the biggest potential for growth in our modern Industrial Strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">This sector plan will help make the UK the number one destination for financial services by 2035 and is all about delivering on our Plan for Change to boost the economy and put more money in people&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Emma Reynolds said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Helping people take advantage of better returns from investing is key to better financial health, giving them a stake in a growing economy and connecting promising businesses with capital. These reforms will make the UK the best location for financial services firms and tear down barriers to investment to growing our economy and making families better off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Leeds Reforms tear down the barriers to attracting investment in the finance sector by reintroducing informed risk-taking into the system, cutting unnecessary red tape, driving more finance into public markets and actively helping international companies to set up in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will position the UK as the number one destination for financial services companies by 2035, attracting business from around the world to harness the knowledge, talent and expertise in financial services hot spots from Glasgow to Leeds, and help the UK achieve an ambitious target to double the growth rate in UK net exports in these services over the next decade.</p>
<h4 id="unlocking-retail-investment">Unlocking retail investment&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The UK has the lowest level of retail investment among G7 countries, meaning savers are not getting the best bang for their buck and UK businesses are starved of an important source of capital.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stocks and shares have performed significantly better than cash savings accounts in recent decades. According to some industry estimates, more than 29 million adults across the UK have cash sitting in a low-interest rate account offering around 1% - while the average return for stocks and shares over the last 10 years is around 9%. If those savers invested &pound;2000 today, they could have &pound;12,000 in 20 years&rsquo; time. This compares to &pound;2,700 if they held this money in a cash account offering 1.5% at the current interest rate, making them over &pound;9,000 better off.</p>
<p>The industry-led ad campaign will help to explain the benefits of investing, and from April 2026 the Financial Conduct Authority will roll out Targeted Support &ndash; allowing banks to alert customers about specific investment opportunities to consider shifting money from a low-return current accounts to higher-performing stocks and shares investments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside a review of risk warnings on investment products to make sure they help people to accurately judge risk levels, this will guide people through a key barrier to investing &ndash; getting lost between large number of investment products on offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Government will continue to consider reforms to ISAs and savings to achieve the right balance between cash savings and investment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a first step, the Government will allow Long Term Asset Funds to be held in Stocks &amp; Shares ISAs next year, allowing more individuals to invest in assets that will support the UK&rsquo;s future success, like innovative businesses and infrastructure &ndash; which can also deliver better returns.</p>
<h4 id="cutting-red-tape-to-attract-investment-and-drive-growth">Cutting red tape to attract investment and drive growth</h4>
<p>Businesses will be welcomed to the UK with open arms and unnecessary financial red tape that stalls inward investment and slows growth will be drastically cut under the plans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A new concierge service within the Office for Investment will harness UK networks globally to actively court international financial services companies, creating a one-stop-shop to promote the UK and provide tailored support to help businesses plan where to invest based on their needs &ndash; better harnessing specialist clusters across the country from asset management in Edinburgh, to Fintech in Leeds and Cardiff, and insurance in Norwich and Norfolk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First-time buyers will be supported to get on the housing ladder, with the Bank of England allowing more lending at over 4.5 times a buyer&rsquo;s income &ndash; which could help 36,000 more people buy a home over its first year and are helping Nationwide support an additional 10,000 first-time buyers by lowering income thresholds for its popular &lsquo;Helping Hand&rsquo; mortgage from tomorrow. Simplified mortgage lending rules being considered by the Financial Conduct Authority will also make it easier for existing borrowers to remortgage, while the introduction of a permanent government-backed Mortgage Guarantee Scheme will secure the availability of high loan-to-value mortgage products in times of economic uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service will be returned to its original purpose as a simple, impartial dispute resolution service which quickly and effectively deals with complaints against financial services firms under today&rsquo;s reforms instead of acting as a quasi-regulator, with its decisions more closely aligned to the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s rules. This takes action on a key business complaint about the unpredictable and inconsistent nature of redress action, boosting firms&rsquo; confidence to invest and innovate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senior Managers and Certification Regime &ndash; which was originally intended to address failures in individual accountability and culture that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis &ndash; has been implemented in a way that creates unnecessary costs for business. Today&rsquo;s reforms will help deliver a commitment to radically streamline the regime, cutting the burden on firms in half.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s Consumer Duty rules were also intended to raise standards in how finance companies treat retail consumers, but today affect the way businesses interact with other businesses &ndash; such as investment banks and asset managers. The Financial Conduct Authority will therefore review how the Consumer Duty applies to these wholesale firms.</p>
<h4 id="freeing-capital-for-investment">Freeing capital for investment&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Capital will be freed up for banks to invest in the UK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>International banks and investors will benefit from greater certainty as the UK backs Bank of England reforms to raise the MREL threshold - the minimum amount of money and certain types of debt that a bank must have - to &pound;25&ndash;40 billion, freeing up billions for lending and investment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>New Basel 3.1 banking rules will be introduced from January 2027 in a way that supports UK competitiveness, with UK-focused lenders given the clarity they need to plan and invest, while the requirements are delayed for the largest firms&rsquo; investment banking activities to ensure the UK is aligned with how other jurisdictions implement the rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ring-fencing regime &ndash; which separates banks&rsquo; retail and investment banking activities &ndash; will be reformed. The Economic Secretary will lead a review looking at how changes can strike the right balance between growth and stability, including protecting consumer deposits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This comes alongside a major review by the Financial Policy Committee of bank capital requirements. The review will inform work by the Government and Bank of England to ensure UK banks can compete internationally and provide vital investment in the economy whilst maintaining the international regulatory standards which are crucial to securing financial stability.</p>
<h4 id="promoting-innovation-and-making-the-uk-the-fintech-capital-of-the-world">Promoting innovation and making the UK the Fintech capital of the world&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Bespoke support will be provided to firms as they start, scale and list, and a pipeline of skills will support financial services firms to seize tomorrow&rsquo;s opportunities for growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Financial business will receive intensive support through the start-up phase, helping them create a proven concept and attract growth funding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A single regulator point of contact will also help these businesses through the scale-up phase, providing technical support to help understand requirements and speeding up regulator responsiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Businesses will also benefit from better access to finance, with the Government recently uplifting the British Business Bank&rsquo;s financial capacity to &pound;25.6 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sector will also be supported by a better pipeline of skills, with a new Global Talent Taskforce helping attract top international talent to the UK, funding for 50 PhD students through the &pound;187 million TechFirst programme to align their research with the needs of key players in the sector and a new financial services skills compact led by the Financial Services Skills Commission to ensure skills needs are met.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="more-information">More information</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness Strategy sector plan can be found on the Treasury&rsquo;s website.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Major&nbsp;financial services firms have agreed to support the campaign on retail investment: Barclays, NatWest, HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group, AJ Bell, Hargreaves Lansdown, Vanguard, Freetrade, Octopus Money, Robinhood UK, Trading 212, St James&rsquo;s Place, Interactive Investor, Schroders and the London Stock Exchange. The Investment Association will provide the secretariat to the campaign. The Money and Pensions Service (MaPS), the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and HM Treasury will support the campaign in an advisory capacity.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figures for how much a saver could benefit from investing in stocks and shares are illustrative. They are not a guarantee of future returns.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The UK will aim to double the real growth rate in net exports of financial services between 2025 and 2035 compared to the last decade (2014-2024). This would mean financial services net exports going from a compound annual growth rate of 1.37% to 2.7%, a cumulative increase in annual financial services net exports of 30% between 2025 and 2035.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mike Reigner, Chief Executive Officer, Santander UK said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the announcement of the Leeds Reforms today, which set out a positive vision for UK financial services. The changes outlined within the package are important steps to modernising the UK&rsquo;s regulatory architecture, and will enable banks like ours to support our customers better and drive growth within the wider economy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Sir Charles Roxburgh KCB, Chair, Lloyd&rsquo;s said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Today&rsquo;s announcements by the Chancellor &mdash; focused on streamlining regulation, reducing burdens on firms, and enabling innovation and growth &mdash; are a real boost for the London insurance market. The Government&rsquo;s clear support for our sector, and its recognition of specialty insurance and reinsurance as a Frontier Industry in its Modern Industrial Strategy, strengthen my confidence in Lloyd&rsquo;s continued success at the heart of the market.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Hannah Gurga, Director General, ABI said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">The Leeds Reforms set a constructive and positive path to accelerating investment and growth in the UK economy. Closer alignment between the FOS and FCA, alongside a streamlined Senior Managers and Certification Regime, are critical steps towards delivering the clarity and regulatory environment our industry needs to thrive. It&rsquo;s encouraging to see the vision set out in the Financial Services Growth and Competitiveness plan, and we look forward to working with the government, regulators and wider industry to help cement the UK&rsquo;s status as the world&rsquo;s leading financial centre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ant&oacute;nio Sim&otilde;es, Group CEO, L&amp;G said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">Driving&nbsp;long-term economic growth and prosperity requires action today and this package is another step in the right direction. Connecting investment capital to the most compelling opportunities, streamlining regulation whilst maintaining standards and protection, and support for consumers to save in ways that will better benefit them in the future is the kind of intervention we need. Now we must keep up the pace&nbsp;and ambition&nbsp;to turn these plans into tangible action that makes a difference on the ground and in people&rsquo;s pockets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chris Cummings, Chief Executive, the Investment Association said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">The Leeds Reforms bring together an ambitious programme for financial services reform, which aims to modernise capital markets, cut regulatory red tape and broaden the benefits of investing to more people across the UK &ndash; in turn delivering investment-led growth and improved financial resilience for UK households. We called on the government to undertake bold reforms to strengthen the UK&rsquo;s retail investment culture and they have done so. Better communication of the returns investing brings is key if we&rsquo;re&nbsp;to empower more people to invest, and we&rsquo;re&nbsp;proud to take part in the industry-led campaign to raise awareness&nbsp;of the benefits of investing and the review of risk warnings. We&rsquo;re&nbsp;also extremely pleased that Long-Term Asset Funds will now be incorporated into the Stocks and Shares ISA &ndash; a reform we have long called for to broaden access to private markets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Drazen Jaksic, Chief Executive Officer, Zurich UK said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the Chancellor&rsquo;s commitment to building a stronger, more resilient UK economy. The focus on sustainable growth, investment in innovation, and fostering long-term confidence is closely aligned with Zurich&rsquo;s own priorities. As one of the UK&rsquo;s leading insurers, we stand ready to work together with policymakers, customers, and partners to help deliver on these goals. We look forward to further engagement with the government to ensure the insurance sector remains robust, innovative, and able to meet the evolving needs of people and businesses across the UK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>David Postings, Chief Executive, UK Finance said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Financial services are vital to the UK economy and I strongly welcome the Chancellor&rsquo;s support for our sector as one of the UK&rsquo;s global strengths.</p>
<p>We submitted a range of ideas to government to help support growth and the UK&rsquo;s position as a global financial centre. Across many of these key areas the Chancellor has listened and delivered significant positive change.</p>
<p>Reforming the Financial Ombudsman Service, streamlining regulation in areas such as the Senior Managers and Certification Regime and the Consumer Duty, and supporting work by regulators to unlock capital for lending, will all help to drive investment and create a more pro-growth operating environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="last-child">Having a regulatory system that allows for appropriate risk-taking is vital to ensuring the sector can better support UK businesses, consumers and the government&rsquo;s growth mission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Charlie Nunn, CEO, Lloyds Banking Group&nbsp;said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="last-child">We welcome the ambition shown in the Leeds Reforms to unlock investment, boost financial resilience, and support long-term economic growth. As a sector, we have a vital role to play in helping customers make the most of their money and in facilitating investment and innovation that benefits communities and businesses across the UK.</p>

<li>The length of time between a prospectus being issued and an initial public offering (IPO) is being halved, helping companies list more quickly on the stock exchange. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Companies will be able to issue corporate bonds to retail investors more easily and a new public offer platform will help smaller growth companies raise cash to scale up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simon Walls, executive director of markets at the FCA, remarked:</p>
<p>'These bold shifts promote innovation, lower costs, and enable a broader investor base for growing businesses. They are the latest in a programme of reforms shifting the balance from pre-emptive checks to market disclosures.</p>
<p>'Our capital markets are world leading. They're our economic engine, and we want to keep them roaring in support of sustained growth and prosperity for the whole country.'</p>
<h2>Prospectus reform</h2>
<p>Companies will not be required to publish a prospectus when raising further capital, except in limited circumstances. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The threshold for when a prospectus is required for a listed company to raise more shares has increased to 75% of existing share capital, up from its current 20% level. This will reduce costs for UK companies seeking new funds by an estimated &pound;40 million per year, unlocking more capital for growth and investment.</p>
<p>IPOs that include the wider public can come to market 3 days after the publication of their prospectus, replacing the previous 6-day window and removing barriers to retail access.</p>
<h2>Corporate Bonds</h2>
<p>The FCA has set out a single disclosure standard for corporate bond prospectuses, covering both large and small bonds. This reduces costs for companies and will make it easier for corporate bonds to be issued in smaller, more investible sizes and support retail investment.</p>
<p>Corporate bonds offer a valuable investment opportunity for retail investors and can provide later life income, helping people navigate their financial lives.</p>
<h2>Public offer platforms (POPs)</h2>
<p>The FCA has set up a new platform for public offers to make it easier for growth companies to get the investment they need and increase opportunities for investors.</p>
<p>It will enable companies to make larger offers of shares or bonds without a lengthy prospectus, above &pound;5 million. Offers will be made available to a broad investor base outside of public markets via an authorised firm. This will work similarly to crowdfunding platforms but for larger deals.</p>

<title>Euroclear To Deliver Post-Trade Infrastructure Connecting All 27 EU Markets In All Financial Asset Classes</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euroclear-to-deliver-post-trade-infrastructure-connecting-all-27-eu-markets-in-a-2025715/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euroclear today unveils a comprehensive plan to establish a true single market for post-trade services across asset classes. This initiative, aimed at enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of European market infrastructure, will support the Savings and Investments Union's (SIU) ambitions and ensure Europe remains the 'go-to place' for investors and issuers globally.</p>
<p>Euroclear's ambitious project will bring a number of significant benefits, including providing seamless connectivity across the single market, encouraging healthy market competition, promoting financial stability, and fostering innovation and accelerated technology adoption. To do so, Euroclear builds on the know-how, scale and global connectivity of its unique model: combining the leading international Central Securities Depository (Euroclear Bank) with its six local CSDs in Europe. This open-model positions Euroclear as Europe's gateway to the world - enabling it to connect global markets, drive innovation and unlock further efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Euroclear commits to provide<b>&nbsp;a single point of access to all 27 Member States across all financial asset classes &ndash; equities, fixed income and all types of funds, by</b>:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Offering both central bank money and commercial bank money access to all&nbsp;EU CSDs by accelerating the full connection of Euroclear Bank to the European Central Bank's Target2-Securities (T2S) platform.</li>
<li>Delivering more efficient and integrated services through enhanced synergies between Euroclear's local CSDs as well as with Euroclear Bank.</li>
</ul>
<p>This action plan will see Euroclear continue to invest in infrastructure and services that contribute to a more efficient single market:&nbsp;</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Providing a pan-European infrastructure for issuers seeking access to a broad investor ecosystem, deep liquidity and cost-effective issuer services.</li>
<li>Enhancing post-trade infrastructure to channel retail and institutional investment towards equities, mutual and alternative fund products.</li>
<li>Building on our leading collateral management solutions to enhance liquidity and stability in global financial markets.</li>
<li>Working with central banks and market participants on the development of next-generation digital infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
<p>To implement this action plan, Euroclear's focus will be to complete Euroclear Bank's commercial bank money access to all 27 EU Member States by 2026. In parallel, we will accelerate Euroclear Bank's connection to T2S to offer Central Bank Money access thereafter.</p>
<p>Val&eacute;rie Urbain, Euroclear's CEO, commented: "<i>The key to more liquid and effective capital markets in Europe is through driving market openness, interconnectivity and maximising choice for users. Only under these conditions can European markets truly thrive and remain competitive at a global level.&nbsp;Today, we are committed to making Euroclear the single-entry point for all asset classes including funds, fixed income and equities across the 27 Member States."</i></p>
<p>Euroclear has been actively contributing to the financing of the European economy and integration of European markets over decades. Today, as the largest CSD group in Europe, Euroclear holds over 50% of all securities issued in the EU and represents over 60% of EU settlement turnover.</p>
<p>To support these efforts, Euroclear has outlined several policy priorities and recommendations [<span><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://email.prnewswire.com/ls/click?upn=u001.45DsQVmEF-2FyGLayFyzX0K7XqQuo15Vs1uZzkoOyfuNxc388kQ0rH8Wj-2BEknkxOnIiukEbZrgi-2Bqi-2B3WHm-2FTXZcgaftp-2BJwikVJw-2B9w5lRbkFHRCuWOcrao5ALsITOAhwvl61Xobi5tusmqn4WX42OT3opHMbHveCOsyYDPJvsvpAMLVh8ig9-2BP4fWJDM0JQlDReMx6BNm6QgtISKJUOuV52uBVBYr17lUKni1OhvJrhisAHQxX0tk03b6xSTCAN7tesMLFIGyBueDBtji4L7fyk0-2BhNIRDnbCIxr8uDze9WGzUJAHReLyCl4qSJ-2BzLGM3Y68sn7SY-2FpuYLIpFBAvxt2pH4tmosLCChYLXBX0DjhX1tyopfEnEsTX3tarByz2uRksdK-2B1LS-2BEAeY-2FL9GxVdOQgRPiwarckRJvnRvlgANEowgGXrNgfOTwsgtYnsdG-2BkFxg-2FL7g1OVjOewxTlCQ4xkRvdjNPj8EqN68plhAi3Nyc4jBOFE05t48Qm3VRitRiDDbSBjie-2FOKzhHgOdNubukirju2hBeXYVS-2BxPy6TaSwlqUreQbcNz9qnQRzAlMY-2BathRAlBCXJjkkOGGjCVfxt5LDA-2FSj0qVA6BwfJ7hb-2FQWlPSFB3HNViqDLOZo3XC-2B08fzokrNj8cYP4Itjj00zYTUYNB99ty4LJptAw4wLSXPJmmRmrwLLm1SPXXvwPLZbtuU-2Fh7aBnsxQXecxbkJZLpLamz-2BesQD4px1xhrJg-3DJ_iT_pIbxPfpDI69aAybPrpOfg1n6CWmKMnb3conIyNKCYgr-2BTRqxLAwMRExIXLpGb5DJ9hApiYlg-2FcH47HUNgs-2FwUuSawam6uH69Sn-2Beh38wFBLKaAphBqy3Lz2R9ba0q2chMlfc-2FlBvfV3FbYyaZRfnize7RDYaJRvWcZ4-2BzVDrzJHMGjFfsvK3ZFxiz-2FRSA77-2F97-2BUMeob23kAiiT5Jn34KyEryagSIPd8yGDbraaoCfg4PRAlpffC-2FbyOFr7-2F4C0EHc5tAx2sbSJ2zw4a-2FeJV0I-2FCaeRbu-2BI7YePcRX7CZX0pRoTfzOzIRPRsfxoOQX0fAatE6H5Av2V2Bi8h-2ByTWZsgfDO0TOHF6hPq27xz0mBY-3D" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.euroclear.com/content/dam/euroclear/news%20&amp;%20insights/Format/PDFs/2025/Euroclear-Policy-Paper_SIU_July-2025.pdf</a></span>] for European policymakers and market participants.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Rydoo, a global leader in expense management solutions, has announced the acquisition of Semine, a leading European provider of AI-powered accounts payable automation (APA) technology.</p>
<p>Rydoo currently supports over 1 million users worldwide in automating expense management, helping finance teams gain real-time control over employees&rsquo; spend while significantly reducing manual workload.</p>
<p>This acquisition marks a significant step in Rydoo&rsquo;s long-term growth strategy, strengthening its position as a leading spend management player across the globe.</p>
<p>Eurazeo, Rydoo&rsquo;s majority shareholder, is fully supporting the company in this growth phase, reinforcing confidence in its vision and market leadership. The terms of the acquisition have not been disclosed.</p>
<p><b>Expense management &amp; accounts payable: the next step towards smarter spend management</b></p>
<p>The acquisition of Semine aligns with Rydoo&rsquo;s mission to empower finance teams with the best-in-class solution for their spend processes. Semine brings a strong domain expertise, trusted customer partnerships, and a powerful technology platform.</p>
<p>By combining market-leading expense management with fully automated AP workflows, Rydoo and Semine are building an end-to-end solution that delivers maximum efficiency, control, and strategic insight.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>End-to-end visibility:</b>&nbsp;Unlocking a unified view of spend, empowering finance leaders to make smarter, faster decisions.</li>

<li><b>Seamless integrations:</b>&nbsp;Rydoo and Semine both offer robust integration capabilities with leading ERP and financial systems, ensuring rapid onboarding and scalability for organisations of all sizes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>This announcement follows a year of strong momentum for Rydoo. In 2024, the company welcomed a new majority shareholder, Eurazeo, providing renewed backing to accelerate its strategic ambitions. Since then, the company has expanded its footprint in the US and continued its strong growth across new geographies, reinforcing its position as a top-tier provider of smart expense management solutions.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Semine marks the next chapter in this journey, deepening Rydoo&rsquo;s offering and setting the stage for continued innovation and global scale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are excited to welcome Semine to the Rydoo family&rdquo;, said&nbsp;<b>Sebastien Marchon, Rydoo&rsquo;s CEO</b>. &ldquo;Both of our companies are rooted in the same essential values: customer obsession, product excellence, humility, collective intelligence, and passion. This is a true convergence of visions, talents, and cultures, bringing us closer to our ambition of building a world-class platform for finance teams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having established ourselves as the leading innovator and fastest-growing provider in accounts payable, I&rsquo;m incredibly excited about our next chapter together with Rydoo. This partnership not only allows us to broaden our product portfolio but also accelerates our ability to bring cutting-edge solutions to a wider European market. What truly matters to me is that Rydoo shares our passion for technology and excellence &mdash; together, we&rsquo;re poised to deliver the most advanced and future-ready offering in the industry&rdquo;, said&nbsp;<b>Bj&oslash;rn R&oslash;sten, Semine&rsquo;s CEO</b></p>
<p><i>"As a leading and fast growing player in the accounts payable space serving a portfolio of blue chips, Semine&rsquo;s acquisition lies at the core of Rydoo&rsquo;s strategic roadmap: build a leading international spend management software. After discussing with several parties, we were impressed by Semine&rsquo;s robust technology, solid growth and outstanding management team. The two companies and teams share a lot in common, making the combination a great match. We&rsquo;re proud to support Sebastien and Bj&oslash;rn&rsquo;s teams in the beginning of their common journey",</i>&nbsp;said Benjamin Hara, Partner at Eurazeo Elevate.</p>

<p>Acting Comptroller of the Currency Rodney E. Hood&rsquo;s five-month tenure at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) was marked by measurable progress in strengthening the federal banking system, reducing regulatory burden, promoting financial inclusion, expanding bank activities involving digital assets and embracing bank-fintech partnerships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serving as the Acting Comptroller of the Currency has been the capstone of my career,&rdquo; said Mr. Hood. &ldquo;Since my arrival, I demonstrated that &lsquo;acting&rsquo; does not mean &lsquo;inactive&rsquo; and I am immensely proud of all the OCC has accomplished in a short amount of time to advance the safety, soundness and fairness of the federal banking system. The system is stronger, more resilient, more inclusive and more innovative today than when I arrived.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When the &lsquo;smart money&rsquo; needs guidance selecting the best funds, fund managers, and asset allocation strategies, they turn to a select group of investment consultants that increasingly serve as gatekeepers between investors and asset managers. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.withintelligence.com/insights/us-investment-consultants/">With Intelligence U.S. Investment Consultants</a>&nbsp;Report, NEPC and Meketa Investment Group were the consultants institutional investors relied on most frequently in 2024, while NEPC and Mercer advised on the highest value of investor mandates.</p>
<p>The first annual With Intelligence U.S. Investment Consultants Report analyzes data from nearly 1,400 U.S. investor mandates, totaling more than $89 billion in value, which closed during calendar year 2024. It identifies the top investment consultants in terms of total mandate volume and dollar value of closed mandates, along with analysis of trends in investment consultant activity by asset class and total assets under advisement. The majority (80%) of mandates tracked were for U.S. defined benefit funds, followed by treasury funds, permanent funds, endowments, trusts, and foundations (15%), and health plans, sovereign wealth funds, defined benefit/defined contribution cash balances and insurance vehicles (5%).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investment consultants have emerged as key figures in the alternative investment strategies of the world&rsquo;s leading institutional investors. But measuring them has always been squishy,&rdquo; said Leanna Orr, Director of Allocator Content at With Intelligence. &ldquo;Within that rarified group of consultants, our data identified an elite handful delivering billions in investment deals to benefit those clients &ndash; the pensioners, students, and workers who depend on their strong returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following are some of the highlights in the With Intelligence U.S. Investment Consultants Report:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>NEPC, Meketa Close Largest Volume of Mandates:</span>&nbsp;NEPC advised on the largest total volume of completed mandates in 2024, with a total of 163. Meketa Investment Group followed with 147 and Mariner Institutional ranked third with 121.</li>
<li><span>NEPC, Mercer Lead on Total Value of Mandates:</span>&nbsp;In terms of the total dollar of mandates advised, NEPC led the way in 2024 with $19 billion in closed searches. Mercer followed with $11.5 billion in completed mandates and Meketa Investment Group ranked third in total mandate value with $8.8.</li>
<li><span>Private Equity/Venture Capital, Equity, Fixed Income and Private Credit See Highest Volume:</span>&nbsp;The asset classes receiving the most attention from investment consultants were private equity/venture capital, with a total of 385 closed mandates. Equity (345), fixed income (189) and private credit (188) strategies also received significant attention from U.S. investment consultants.</li>
<li><span>Aksia, Meketa Lead in Total Assets Under Advisement for alternatives:</span>&nbsp;When it comes to total assets under advisement for alternative asset classes, during calendar year 2024, Aksia led the way with $5.5 billion, followed closely by Maketa with $5.1 billion.</li>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>It is truly my pleasure to welcome you all today to the Regulators Roundtable on Financial Markets Innovation and Supervision of Emergent Technology. My sincere and tremendous gratitude to everyone who has gathered here in London today. This year marks the third year that I have had the privilege of convening an exceptional group of senior prudential and market regulators representing diverse jurisdictions around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>Our discussion this afternoon will focus on forces that are rapidly transforming the financial services sector of the global economy with particular emphasis on two elements of the increasingly digitized financial services sector&mdash;the integration of artificial intelligence and the threat of cyber risks.</span></p>
<p><span>For each of us&mdash;whether we&rsquo;re shaping monetary policy, evaluating compliance with current regulatory guidelines, enforcing transparency and accountability in banking, capital markets, derivatives markets or digital asset markets, or supervising the next generation of digital finance platforms&mdash;the topics on today&rsquo;s agenda are top of mind.</span></p>
<p><span>Today we are continuing the conversations launched during the previous roundtables. Each of these topics have only become more important in the year since we last gathered.</span></p>
<p><span>Let&rsquo;s begin with artificial intelligence (AI).</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>AI in Financial Markets and Financial Markets Regulation&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>AI holds significant promise for making financial services more inclusive, efficient, and accessible. But its deployment must be underpinned by robust governance, ethical design, and global regulatory collaboration. For global regulatory leadership&mdash;including this august group convened today&mdash;the challenge is to balance innovation with stability, openness with security, and automation with human oversight.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Improving Accuracy, Efficiency, and Operational Resilience</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Evidence suggests that AI improves accuracy, efficiency, and operational resilience and that AI-driven systems may outperform traditional approaches. Some potential applications include:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fraud Detection and Risk Management</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Anomaly Detection</strong>: AI systems can detect unusual transaction patterns in real-time, flagging potential fraud or cyber threats more effectively than traditional rule-based systems.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Behavioral Biometrics</strong>: Advanced models track behavioral traits (typing speed, swipe patterns) to authenticate users and reduce identity theft.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Process Automation</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)</strong>: AI extracts, classifies, and processes information from unstructured documents (e.g., loan applications, KYC documents), reducing processing time and human error.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Trade Surveillance &amp; Market Monitoring</strong>: AI can sift through vast quantities of data to detect signs of market manipulation, insider trading, or compliance breaches with greater precision.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Enhancing Compliance with Regulation and Reducing the Costs of Compliance&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>AI promises to reduce transaction and compliance costs by dynamically routing orders to the best venues, reducing slippage and lowering transaction costs. Evidence suggests that AI improves accuracy, efficiency, and operational resilience. AI-driven systems may outperform traditional approaches for detecting fraud, managing risks, executing back-office services, verifying identity, surveilling markets for evidence of market manipulation, insider trading, and compliance breaches.</span></p>
<p><span>AI also promises to enhance supervisory technology for regulators&mdash;automating data collection, analysis, and reporting, reducing frictions with regulatory compliance, and enabling more dynamic regulation at reduced costs. AI may facilitate efficient, faster-paced updating and modernization of regulation. AI may also offer continuous monitoring and enhanced real-time confirmation of compliance, reducing reliance on less frequent, periodic audits, and facilitating market participants and regulators&rsquo; ability to identify regulatory breaches earlier and potentially reducing the number and size of regulatory breaches.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Reducing Transaction and Compliance Costs</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Transaction Costs</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Smart Routing and Algorithmic Trading</strong>: AI optimizes trade execution by dynamically routing orders to the best venues, reducing slippage and transaction costs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Compliance and Regulatory Reporting</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>RegTech Solutions</strong>: AI-powered regulatory technology automates data collection, analysis, and reporting, easing the burden of compliance with dynamic regulations.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Continuous Monitoring</strong>: AI systems can provide real-time compliance checks rather than periodic audits, leading to faster resolution and fewer regulatory breaches.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Industry Use Cases</strong></span></p>
<p><span>While the financial services industry has integrated predictive technologies in risk assessment and predictive analytics for decades, over the last several years, we have witnessed a transformational shift in the diversity of use cases. In 2017, JPMorgan Chase launched a contract intelligence platform that automates review of commercial credit agreements, reducing by hundreds of thousands of hours the human resources annually required to complete credit agreement reviews.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a><span>&nbsp;HSBC, and a number of other financial institutions, have integrated AI in their transaction monitoring and anti-money laundering (AML) platforms to detect anomalies across millions of transactions in real-time, increasing accuracy in their assessment of suspicious activity reports.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Similar to other financial services firms, Mastercard has launched cyber risk and fraud detection software that relies on AI to analyze 75 billion transactions per year to block fraud in milliseconds.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Risks and Considerations for Policymakers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>In testimony before Congress, published academic literature, and a series of speeches during my tenure as a Commissioner at the CFTC, I have outlined and encouraged regulators to explore a number of risks and considerations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, we face real concerns around bias in AI models, especially when it comes to lending and underwriting. There is a need for greater transparency and explainability, so that AI driven decisions are subject to the rigorous accountability standards that we typically apply in our supervisory oversight. And as AI becomes more embedded in core infrastructure, cyber resilience becomes a systemic concern, not just an operational one.</span></p>
<p><span>There is also the matter of concentration risk. As more institutions rely on a handful of foundational AI models or platforms, we must ask: what happens when those systems fail or are compromised? I outline a few additional risks below:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Bias and Fairness</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Model Transparency</strong>: AI decisions, especially in lending or insurance, must be explainable to ensure non-discriminatory practices.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Data Integrity</strong>: Models are only as good as the data they are trained on&mdash;bad data can perpetuate historical inequalities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Cybersecurity and Resilience</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Adversarial AI</strong>: As AI becomes embedded in core infrastructure, it's also a target for manipulation&mdash;highlighting the need for robust, secure design.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Systemic Concentration</strong>: Overreliance on a few AI platforms or vendors could increase systemic vulnerabilities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Governance and Accountability</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Model Risk Management</strong>: Institutions must manage the full lifecycle of AI models&mdash;development, validation, deployment, and monitoring&mdash;with strong oversight.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Cross-Border Coordination</strong>: Global consistency in AI governance frameworks will be crucial to avoid regulatory arbitrage and ensure responsible innovation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Next Steps in Governing AI</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Governance&mdash;at the firm level and the system level&mdash;matters more than ever. Fintechs must invest in model risk management, ethical design, and responsible data practices. Supervisory approaches must evolve to keep pace with the changes occurring in the markets subject to our supervision.</span></p>
<p><span>Regulatory agencies in the US are increasingly deploying AI to review large volumes of data and detect emerging risks by identifying outliers. Using AI in this capacity, often referred to as &ldquo;suptech,&rdquo; may offer regulators more effective tools to combat fraud, market manipulation, illicit finance, money-laundering and other long-standing threats to the integrity of our markets.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Cyber Risks</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I have encouraged diverse stakeholders to be mindful of potential cyber risks that may impact individual firms or the broader financial markets ecosystem.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p><span>We continue to discuss these risks. As we consider them, let&rsquo;s think about the potential implications of interdependence and the possibility of contagion&mdash;the threat that a domino effect of risks may occur at an accelerated speed.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Operational Resilience</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Over the past few years, we have made progress in preparing ourselves to take on these challenges.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB">The Commission issued a proposed rule, unanimously supported,&nbsp;</span><span>to create an operational resilience framework for futures commission merchants, swap dealers, and major swap participants to &ldquo;identify, monitor, manage, and assess risks relating to information and technology security, third-party relationships, and emergencies or other significant disruptions to normal business operations&rdquo; in December 2023.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Cyber resilience is a critical gateway issue for protecting market integrity, and an area where we need to be &ldquo;all hands on deck&rdquo; on both sides of the pond. Cyber resilience is only as strong as its weakest link. As most cyber threats may be launched against financial institutions in many nations, it is important to stay vigilant and collaborate closely on best practices and lessons learned.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB"><strong>Third-Party Risk Management</strong></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">As I discussed in recent remarks, the Market Risk Advisory Committee that I sponsor at the CFTC has been actively focused on cyber resilience and third-party risk management issues.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB">When the Commission released its proposed operational resilience framework, a subcommittee workstream of the MRAC&nbsp;</span><span>recognized that there may have been some important gaps in operational resilience with respect to other market participants, such as central counterparties regulated by the CFTC, and took up the mantle to continue to examine areas not fully addressed by the Commission. The CCP Risk &amp; Governance Committee organized recommendations that were presented to the commission that &ldquo;would improve upon the existing framework and require that derivatives clearing organizations establish, implement, and maintain a third-party relationship management program.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Many aspects of the recommendations were informed by internationally recognized best practices and international standard setting bodies, such as the Bank for International Settlements Principles for Financial Market Infrastructure. Once again, this highlights the importance of international collaboration, in setting the standard for best practices, and for developing policies that are familiar to global market participants.</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to discussing today the latest developments in third party risk management, such as new principles on third-party risk supervision issued by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) just last month.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson23?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>International Coordination and Cooperation&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As we move across the landscape of emerging technologies and the attendant risks, it is increasingly clear that international cooperation is not optional&mdash;it is essential. Innovative technologies and the risks that may arise&nbsp;as a result of&nbsp;digitization are not bound by jurisdictional, territorial, or national boundaries. The threats or risks born in one nation may quickly ripple across continents.</span></p>
<p><span>A vulnerability in a third-party service provider can contemporaneously compromise multiple financial institutions. A sophisticated actor can launch a cyber-attack from anywhere in the world, orchestrating the consequences such that they impact any one nation or group of nations simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span>Let me highlight a few ways we are already working together on these issues, and where we must go further.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>First, harmonizing regulatory expectations.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We need to align our supervisory approaches across jurisdictions to ensure that cyber risk is being addressed consistently. The Financial Stability Board, CPMI-IOSCO, and other international standard setting bodies have already announced important principles&mdash;but implementation must be global, not fragmented.</span></p>
<p><span>Standards like NIST, ISO 27001, and the FSB&rsquo;s cyber incident response guidance should form the backbone of our shared expectations. It is worth exploring mutual recognition of cyber audits and certifications for third-party providers, especially cloud platforms.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Second, information sharing.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Timely, secure, and actionable intelligence must flow across borders&mdash;not just between regulators, but also with the private sector. There are institutions that are&nbsp;helping to build these bridges, but we need to enhance real-time alert systems and threat-sharing protocols. Silence, in the cyber domain, is a vulnerability.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Third, we must strengthen crisis response and recovery.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Too often, we focus on prevention. But in today&rsquo;s threat landscape, we must assume that breaches will occur&mdash;and focus on how we respond.</span></p>
<p><span>That means building interoperable incident response plans. Conducting joint cyber drills and tabletop exercises simulations and establishing trusted communications channels that can activate instantly in the event of a cross-border incident.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Fourth, we must tackle concentration risk and supply chain vulnerabilities.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Many of our institutions rely on the same cloud providers, fintech APIs, and software stacks. We need a coordinated approach to supervising these critical third parties&mdash;through shared resilience testing, pooled audits, and transparent incident reporting.</span></p>
<p><span>And finally, we must invest in cyber capacity building, especially in emerging and developing economies. Because in a globally interconnected system, our resilience is only as strong as the weakest link. Let us support these markets with the tools, training, and frameworks they need&mdash;not just to defend themselves, but to contribute to the global cyber defense ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>&mdash;</strong></span><span><strong>&nbsp;Looking Ahead</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The cyber threat landscape is evolving quickly&mdash;AI-powered attacks, deepfakes, quantum computing threats, and vulnerabilities in decentralized finance are no longer theoretical.</span></p>
<p><span>To meet these challenges, we must act together&mdash;with speed, with coordination, and with trust. This is no small ask, and we can&rsquo;t do it alone.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us make cybersecurity a shared responsibility. Let us foster the partnerships&mdash;public and private,&nbsp;domestic&nbsp;and international&mdash;that are essential to securing our financial future.</span></p>
<p><span>Because in today&rsquo;s world, cyber resilience is not just a technology issue&mdash;it is a financial stability imperative.</span></p>
<p><span>Finally, our convenings and conversations must continue.&nbsp;Trust can be a competitive advantage if we let it</span><span>&mdash;</span><span>a most potent tool in our toolbox to help us unlock the potential of new technology while also maintaining effective governance structures that give us the confidence and stability to keep moving forward.</span></p>
<p><span>I am hopeful as we continue to convene, as regulators, and with the broader communities we serve, that we can develop standards and best practices that can be relied on around the globe.</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to hearing the different thoughts and approaches that will be shared today on these issues that are top of mind for our markets globally.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em><span><sub>In his first letter to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors as FSB Chair, Andrew Bailey stresses the importance of international coordination on financial regulation against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions.</sub></span></em></li>
<li><span><sub>Mr Bailey highlights his priorities for the FSB, namely enhancing surveillance capabilities, addressing key risks to financial stability, and strengthening the effectiveness of the FSB.</sub></span></li>
<li><span><sub>He also presents the latest report on the FSB&rsquo;s climate roadmap, which sets out for the G20 that the focus of the FSB climate work in the medium term will be international coordination, information sharing, and strengthening the analysis of the potential for climate-related financial vulnerabilities.</sub></span></li>
</ul>
<p><sub>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-chairs-letter-to-g20-finance-ministers-and-central-bank-governors-july-2025/">letter from its Chair, Andrew Bailey, to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors</a>&nbsp;ahead of their meeting on 17-18&nbsp;July.</sub></p>
<p><sub>In his first letter as FSB Chair, Mr&nbsp;Bailey calls for continued global cooperation and engagement, particularly against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and rising fragmentation risk.</sub></p>
<p><sub>Mr Bailey outlines his priorities for the FSB, notably:</sub></p>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><sub><span>Enhancing surveillance capabilities</span>: the FSB and national authorities&rsquo; assessment tools and surveillance capabilities must adapt to the evolving financial system to detect vulnerabilities and allow a targeted, evidence-based response to risks. As part of this, the FSB is to set out concisely &ndash; and publish &ndash; its assessments of vulnerabilities.</sub></li>
<li><sub><span>Addressing key risks to financial stability</span>: alongside giving more focus to existing initiatives such as the G20 cross-border payments roadmap, the FSB will: (i)&nbsp;support robust implementation of agreed policies on Nonbank Financial Intermediation (NBFI); (ii) explore vulnerabilities from the growing role of private finance; (iii) assess the increasing role of stablecoins for payment and settlement purposes.</sub></li>
<li><sub><span>Strengthening the effectiveness of the FSB</span>: the&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/06/fsb-appoints-randal-k-quarles-to-lead-g20-strategic-review-of-implementation-monitoring/">G20 Implementation Monitoring Review</a><a href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/06/fsb-appoints-randal-k-quarles-to-lead-g20-strategic-review-of-implementation-monitoring/">&nbsp;</a>will be the starting point for considering possible improvements in the FSB effectiveness, not just with regard to the implementation of agreed standards, but also in other areas such as communicating with stakeholders outside of its membership.</sub></li>
</ul>
<p><sub>The letter covers three reports the FSB is delivering to the G20: (i) the FSB&rsquo;s<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/leverage-in-nonbank-financial-intermediation-final-report/">&nbsp;policy recommendations to address financial stability risks created by leverage in nonbank financial intermediation</a>, (ii) a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-workplan-to-address-nonbank-data-challenges/">workplan to address challenges related to nonbank data</a><a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-workplan-to-address-nonbank-data-challenges/">&nbsp;</a>&ndash; both of which were published last week; and (iii) a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-financial-risks-from-climate-change-2025-update/">report updating on work conducted under the FSB Climate roadmap</a><a class="status-publish" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-roadmap-for-addressing-financial-risks-from-climate-change-2025-update/">&nbsp;</a>and outlining the FSB&rsquo;s medium-term approach to potential climate-related financial risks, delivered together with the Chair&rsquo;s letter.</sub></p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><sub>Background</sub></h2>
<p><sub>The FSB coordinates at the international level the work of national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies and develops and promotes the implementation of effective regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies in the interest of financial stability. It brings together national authorities responsible for financial stability in 24 countries and jurisdictions, international financial institutions, sector-specific international groupings of regulators and supervisors, and committees of central bank experts. The FSB also conducts outreach with approximately 70 other jurisdictions through its six Regional Consultative Groups.</sub></p>
<p><sub>The FSB is chaired by Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England. The FSB Secretariat is located in Basel, Switzerland and hosted by the Bank for International Settlements.</sub></p>

<p>Federal bank regulatory agencies today issued a joint statement in their continued efforts to provide clarity on banks&rsquo; engagement in crypto-asset-related activities. The statement highlights for banks potential risk-management considerations related to holding crypto-assets on their customers&rsquo; behalf, or crypto-asset safekeeping.</p>
<p>The joint statement discusses existing risk-management principles that apply to crypto-asset safekeeping and reminds banks that provide or are considering providing safekeeping of such assets that they must do so in a safe and sound manner and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The statement does not create any new supervisory expectations. The agencies continue to explore ways to provide additional clarity with respect to banks&rsquo; engagement in crypto-asset-related activities.</p>

<title>CalPERS Announces Preliminary 11.6% Return For 2024-25 Fiscal Year</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/calpers-announces-preliminary-116-return-for-2024-25-fiscal-year-2025714/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>CalPERS today reported a preliminary net investment return of 11.6% for the 12-month period ending June 30, 2025, bringing the Public Employees&rsquo; Retirement Fund (PERF) total assets under management to approximately $556.2 billion.</p>
<p>The strong return beat the fund&rsquo;s discount rate of 6.8%, which is comparable to an assumed rate of return established by the CalPERS Board of Administration. The return also surpassed the benchmark used to gauge the PERF&rsquo;s performance by 1.7%.</p>
<p>As a result, the overall estimated funded status of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/investments/about-investment-office/investment-organization/investment-fund-values" target="_blank">PERF</a>&nbsp;increased to 79%. The funded status stood at 71.4% in 2023 and 75% in 2024.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In just two years, our investment returns have helped CalPERS increase the funded status to nearly 80% and rebound from the economic effects of the pandemic,&rdquo; said Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost. &ldquo;Although there is more work to be done, I am proud to say that CalPERS is delivering for its members and employers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CalPERS last&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025/01/acfr-2024.pdf" target="_blank">reported (PDF)</a>&nbsp;a 9.3% return for the 2023-24 fiscal year.</p>
<p>CalPERS&rsquo; largest asset class led the way during fiscal year 2024-25. Public equity investments, which comprise approximately 39% of the fund, outperformed all other asset classes with an estimated 16.8% return.</p>
<p>Private equity earned a 14.3% return, a result of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calpers.ca.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025/01/acfr-2024.pdf" target="_blank">strategy overhaul (PDF)</a>&nbsp;in 2022 that included more co-investments. The strategy is also credited for a 10% cut in the management fee over the last few years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notably, the private equity portfolio ranked as the best performing of its peers for calendar year 2024.</p>
<p>Private debt provided an estimated return of 12.8%.</p>
<p>Fixed income and real assets reported returns of 6.5% and 2.7%, respectively, for the fiscal year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Despite some market headwinds earlier in the year, our investment strategy paid off,&rdquo; said Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore. &ldquo;The team remains poised to take advantage of investment opportunities as they develop and to strike the best possible deals to boost returns and cut costs for the fund.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Mid-Year SIFMA Economist Roundtable Survey Forecasts 0.9% Real GDP Growth In 2025 And Rate Cuts By End Of 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/mid-year-sifma-economist-roundtable-survey-forecasts-09-real-gdp-growth-in-202-2025714/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) published the results of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/research/economics/us-economic-survey/">Economic Advisory Roundtable biannual survey</a>.</p>
<p>The Roundtable is comprised of the chief U.S. economists from over 20 global and regional financial institutions. The survey assesses the current economic landscape, tariff policy, inflation and monetary policy, the economic outlook, and more. The Roundtable expects GDP growth to slow to around 0.9% Q4/Q4 in 2025 from 2.5% in 2024, before recovering to 1.9% Q4/Q4 in 2026, according to the median forecast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The economy has downshifted sharply since the second half of 2024, as big changes in tariffs, trade policy, immigration, Federal tax, and spending policies are taking center stage while the Federal Reserve and monetary policy takes an unfamiliar backseat,&rdquo; said Scott Anderson, Ph.D., Co-Chair of the SIFMA Economist Roundtable and Chief U.S. Economist and Managing Director at BMO. &ldquo;Until the dust settles &ndash; especially around tariff policy and interest rates &ndash; the economic and inflation uncertainty they generate will remain a big part of our economic and financial future. Although recession risks remain elevated, panelists don&rsquo;t expect tariffs to reach their heights seen on April 2nd and aren&rsquo;t likely to trigger an outright recession this year or next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Monetary Policy</span>: 75% of our economists expect one or more rate cuts by the end of 2025 for a total decrease of roughly 50bps. The median forecaster looks for the midpoint of the target range to end 2025 at 3.926% (roughly 50 bps in cuts from current rate) and to end 2026 at 3.625% (a total of 75 bps in cuts from the current rate). Nearly 60% of our economists estimate the neutral nominal fed funds rate to be 3.0%-3.5%.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inflation:</span>&nbsp;The median forecaster looks for core PCE inflation to end 2025 at 3.1% (year-over-year), up 0.7 pps from the last full survey in November 2024 and 0.3 pps higher than the March 2025 flash poll. The top factors influencing forecasts for core inflation estimates are trade policy, inflation expectations, and growth in domestic demand.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Economy:</span>&nbsp;The median economist forecasts real GDP will grow 0.9% in 2025; -1.0 pps from our last full survey in November 2024 and -0.6 pps from the March 2025 flash poll. Over 70% of our economists put the probability of recession from 30% to 50%. The top factors impacting US economic growth are US trade policy, US labor market developments, and US monetary policy. US trade policy also shows up near the top in both upside and downside risks to the economy.</li>
<li>This report also includes forecast tables and charts for the full survey results, as well as an update on where we are in the economic landscape and a reference guide on historical trends for select economic data.</li>

<title>Alberta Securities Commission Permanently Bans Raymond Cawaling And RTAX Financial Corp. For Contravening Alberta Securities Laws</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Alberta Securities Commission (ASC) has sanctioned Raymond Cawaling and RTAX Financial Corp. (the Respondents) for illegally distributing securities and perpetrating a fraud on investors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between October 2016 and November 2019, the Respondents misappropriated at least CAD$462,421 from investors who were told that the funds would be used to invest in or provide loans to third parties, including an overseas mining company. An ASC panel previously found that a significant portion of the money was redirected for personal use, to repay unrelated debts, and to pay principal and interest to other investors in a Ponzi-like scheme.</p>
<p>The panel has ordered the Respondents to jointly pay $462,421 as a result of their non-compliance with Alberta securities laws, plus an administrative penalty of $175,000 and investigation and hearing costs of $81,755. In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cawaling is ordered to resign from all positions he may have as a director or officer of any issuer and is subject to a broad array of permanent market-access bans.</li>
<li>RTAX is ordered to permanently cease trading in, purchasing, or advising in securities or derivatives.</li>
<li>All trading in or purchasing of RTAX securities must cease.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>In its decision, the panel noted that the Respondents&rsquo; misconduct caused harm to both investors and Alberta&rsquo;s capital market, and stated that in addition to sanctions related to the fraud, &ldquo;consequences must also fall on those who illegally distribute securities and deprive investors of the protections our regulatory system is intended to provide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A copy of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Notices-Decisions-Orders-Rulings/Enforcement/2025/07/CAWALING-Raymond-DECISION-20250709-6237106.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">decision</a>&nbsp;is available on the ASC website at asc.ca.</p>
<p>The ASC is the regulatory agency responsible for administering the province's securities laws. It is entrusted with fostering a fair and efficient capital market in Alberta and with protecting investors. As a member of the Canadian Securities Administrators, the ASC works to improve, coordinate and harmonize the regulation of Canada's capital markets.</p>

<title>The Digital Euro: Legal Tender In The Digital Age - Introductory Statement By Piero Cipollone, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, At The Committee On Economic And Monetary Affairs Of The European Parliament</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-digital-euro-legal-tender-in-the-digital-age-introductory-statement-by-pi-2025714/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-digital-euro-legal-tender-in-the-digital-age-introductory-statement-by-pi-2025714/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a class="link-inline" id="_Hlk203382455"></a>Thank you for inviting me to take part in&nbsp;this exchange of views. I would like to talk about why we need the digital euro &ndash; and the cost of not pursuing it.</p>
<p>My message is simple. The main reason for issuing a digital euro is to preserve the benefits of cash in the digital era. To do so, we need to complement physical cash with a digital form of cash.</p>
<p>The inability to use physical cash in online transactions or for digital payments at the point of sale deprives us of a key payment option, reducing resilience, competition, sovereignty and, ultimately, consumers&rsquo; freedom to choose how to pay.</p>
<p>This increases the risks that European consumers, merchants and policymakers face. For a growing number of their transactions, Europeans lack access to central bank money &ndash; the money that is backed by the sovereign and has legal tender status, underpinning our monetary union because it is accepted everywhere in the euro area.</p>
<h2>Monetary sovereignty and people&rsquo;s freedom to pay with legal tender: two sides of the same coin</h2>
<p>The Eurosystem is committed to cash and will continue to issue it.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;But people&rsquo;s habits are shifting towards digital payments.</p>
<p>As the role of online payments has grown, the role of cash in day-to-day transactions has been declining at pace: between 2019 and 2024 its share fell from 68% to 40% in volume terms and from 40% to 24% in value terms.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>This has two important implications.</p>
<p>First, the role of cash will be significantly reduced if we do not provide a digital equivalent. If we fail to act, we will fail to fulfil our responsibility as a central bank towards the people we serve.</p>
<p>Second, our monetary sovereignty is eroding.&nbsp;People&rsquo;s ability to pay across the euro area with sovereign money &ndash; cash &ndash; and frequently choosing to do so, is a key pillar of monetary sovereignty. A digital form of cash would protect our sovereignty and ensure our monetary union is also a digital monetary union.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s particularly concerning in Europe is that the gap left by declining cash use is being filled by non-European payment solutions. For card payments, only seven out of the 20 euro area countries have a national card scheme. These card schemes cannot be used in other euro area countries and are also losing market share domestically. For e-commerce, European-owned solutions are prevalent in only three euro area countries.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span><sup></sup></p>
<h2>Strengthening our legal tender to stop the erosion of our monetary sovereignty</h2>
<p>To address this situation, the Single Currency Package protects the rights of those who want to continue to pay with cash, while complementing physical cash with a digital form of the legal tender: the digital euro.</p>
<p>I believe we are being presented with a false choice: a private pan-euro area payment solution or a public one. First, it is not just about payments; it is about the evolution of the money. And second, it is a historical fact that state-issued money and money issued by private parties have typically coexisted, reinforcing each other.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h2>The cost of inaction</h2>
<p>Since the start of the euro, we have recognised the need for an integrated retail payments market. This prompted the development of the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) to harmonise bank transfers. However, SEPA does not cover key use cases such as payments at the point of sale.</p>
<p>Over the years, private firms have made several attempts to create a pan-European payment solution, but difficulties in coordinating among market participants prevented those firms from delivering a scalable and unified system.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Some 25 years after the launch of the euro, we still have no European payment solution that allows people to pay digitally throughout the euro area in stores, for e‑commerce goods and services and from person to person.</p>
<p>Let us take a leap of faith. Imagine things would be different this time and that banks would manage to work together to rapidly provide a pan-European private payment solution. Would it still make sense to have the digital euro? The answer is yes.</p>
<p>First, the digital euro would help preserve money as a public good that is easily accessible to everyone and universally accepted across the euro area. By contrast, private money belongs to the competitive space, so we cannot guarantee its acceptance by all merchants.</p>
<p>Second, the digital euro would enhance resilience. We would have a reliable fallback in times of crisis, complementing cash. An especially important feature is that the digital euro would also function offline, providing a secure payment method even without an internet connection.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, as is the case with cash, we would be sure that all components of the digital euro remain in European hands.</p>
<p>Third, the digital euro would prevent market concentration. The availability of legal tender and its wide adoption would put merchants in a stronger position to negotiate fees. In addition, the digital euro would create open standards with a wide acceptance network, making it easier for payment service providers to scale up their solutions. This would result in greater competition and innovation at European level.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250714~437cfc6a51.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union entrusts you, the co-legislators, to &ldquo;lay down the measures necessary for the use of the euro as the single currency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We can together ensure that our currency is fit for the digital age by complementing physical cash and private payment initiatives with digital cash. Indeed, the digital euro is key to preserving the benefits of cash in the digital era.</p>

<p>G10 central banks have stated: &ldquo;the composite of central and commercial bank money, convertible at par, is essential to the safety and efficiency of the financial system and should remain the basis of the singleness of the currency&rdquo; (see Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2003),&nbsp;<a class="link-inline pdf" href="https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d55.pdf"><em>The role of central bank money in payment systems</em></a>, Bank for International Settlements, August).</p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-6">
<p>The example of instant payments shows that, despite advances in regulation and technology, the market has failed to deliver a scalable solution due to problems in coordinating among market participants. Also, the European Payments Council and industry groups have worked on common standards (e.g. SEPA Cards Framework), but no concrete unification of card networks has materialised.</p>
</li>
<li id="footnote-7">
<p>This contrasts with a historical example of ensuring resilience. Between 1964 and 1988 it was a state secret that the Bundesbank held 15 billion Deutsche Marks in substitute currency in the Cochem bunker. The Deutsche Mark had by then established its credibility as an international currency. Germany feared that counterfeit money could be smuggled into the country in large quantities in order to undermine confidence in the Deutsche Mark and bring down the economy. Had this happened, the substitute currency would have been distributed to ensure the continuity of everyday commerce.</p>

<p>The digital euro rulebook would mandate common standards across the euro area. The digital euro acceptance standards would be made available for free to private parties, who would be able to use them as a basis for developing their services. This would help private providers achieve pan-European acceptance on a technical level, leading to cost efficiencies and a more integrated European payment market. The expansion of both their geographical reach and their portfolio of products would, in turn, make it easier for them to compete internationally. While technical acceptance would be guaranteed, commercial agreements would still be needed. For more information, see Cipollone, P.

<title>Remarks By Commissioner Dombrovskis On The Digital Euro Before The European Parliament's Committee On Economic And Monetary Affairs</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you. Honourable Chairs, Honourable Members:</p>
<p>It is my pleasure to return to the European Parliament for this exchange on the digital euro.</p>
<p>The euro has now existed for more than a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>Of course, the world has changed a great deal since the euro was introduced.</p>
<p>Technology is evolving at a breathtaking rate, transforming the way we live, work, and interact with one another.</p>
<p>These changes are also reflected in how we use our currency.</p>
<p>More and more Europeans are choosing to pay digitally.</p>
<p>The share of cash payments&nbsp; in the euro area at the point of sale has dropped between 2019 and 2024 from 72% to 52%.</p>
<p>Europe needs to be at the forefront of embracing the digital age and making the most of all the opportunities that it offers.</p>
<p>The rest of the world is quickly adapting to these changes.</p>
<p>And if Europe does not, we risk being left behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what our proposal for the digital euro comes in.</p>
<p>A digital euro &mdash; securely issued and backed by the European Central Bank &mdash; offers the potential to modernise our payment systems, strengthen the global role of the euro, improve financial inclusion, and reinforce monetary sovereignty in the digital age.</p>
<p>The digital euro presents users with significant advantages and opportunities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the digital euro would be a seamless means of payment usable throughout the euro area, regardless of where payers are located and which commercial bank or payment service provider they use.</p>
<p>Users would be able to pay anytime, everywhere across the euro area, and payments will be sent and received instantly 24/7, 365 days a year.</p>
<p>The digital euro would also provide for the possibility to pay digitally, even without access to the internet.</p>
<p>Lastly, the digital euro would also benefit merchants, who would pay lower fees for accepting digital payments.</p>
<p>In addition to the advantages for end users, the digital euro also brings great advantages to our sovereignty in payments.</p>
<p>Today, the space left behind by declining cash use is being covered by non-EU payment solutions.</p>
<p>We simply cannot afford to cede technological control over the EU's economy entirely to others.</p>
<p>As other nations develop and promote alternative digital currencies for international trade, the EU must act to ensure that the euro enhances its role as a strategic reserve currency.</p>
<p>A digital euro, properly executed, would reinforce this position.</p>
<p>Recent developments in today's more complex, conflictual world have further underlined the urgency of making progress on the introduction of the digital euro.</p>
<p>The digital euro can be an important pillar in strengthening the EU's strategic autonomy by increasing the euro's resilience vis-&agrave;-vis other currencies, payment systems, third country Central Bank Denominated Currencies and &ldquo;stablecoins&rdquo; not denominated in euro.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to briefly address some of the concerns that have been raised regarding the digital euro.</p>
<p>Firstly, for private sector payment providers and banks.</p>
<p>The digital euro is not intended to compete with private payment solutions, but rather to provide a complementary solution that can foster innovation and competition in the retail payments market.</p>
<p>The digital euro will work in close cooperation with the private sector.</p>
<p>Its open access standards will be made available to the private sector, enabling them to build innovative payment solutions on top of the digital euro and expand their services seamlessly across national borders within the EU.</p>
<p>The policy choice is not whether we promote private payments or the digital euro, but how we can foster both - as they complement each other in achieving our policy objectives, especially the autonomy of European retail payments.</p>
<p>The digital euro will not change the critical role that banks play in financial intermediation in our economies.</p>
<p>By introducing holding limits, among other safeguards, our proposal ensures that the digital euro would never jeopardise the financial stability of the EU or the intermediary function of the banks.</p>
<p>On privacy,&nbsp;I want to be very clear: Guaranteeing citizens' rights to privacy is one of the fundamental pillars of the Commission's proposal for the digital euro.</p>
<p>The digital euro will provide cash-like privacy in the digital world for offline payments and a high degree of privacy for online payments.</p>
<p>This will ensure that central banks can never identify users.</p>
<p>The fundamental right to privacy has been a central issue when designing the proposal for the digital euro.</p>
<p>The proposal therefore strikes the right balance between citizens' legitimate request for cash-like privacy in payments and the need to contain money laundering, terrorist financing and fraud risks.</p>
<p>On cash:&nbsp;The digital euro will be an additional choice for consumers.</p>
<p>It will complement and not replace cash.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a sign of the Commission's determination to safeguard the right to pay in euro cash and have easy access to cash, the Commission proposed a regulation on the legal tender of euro cash alongside the digital euro proposal.</p>
<p>Both proposals make it clear that people will have the choice to pay in euro banknotes and coins or in digital euro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final point, I am proud to say that the digital euro will be an inclusive means of payment.</p>
<p>Our legislative proposal includes a number of requirements to ensure accessibility for unbanked people, people with disabilities, functional limitations or limited digital skills.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the digital euro has the potential to provide a pan-European means of payment that is widely available and accepted throughout the euro area.</p>
<p>This will, in turn, promote innovation and competition, while offering an extra choice that complements cash and private payments.</p>
<p>We look forward to working closely with the European Parliament to make this vision a reality.</p>
<p>I look forward to your questions. Thank you.</p>

<title>XTransfer: Pioneering AI-Driven Transformation In B2B Foreign Trade Payment</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/xtransfer-pioneering-ai-driven-transformation-in-b2b-foreign-trade-payment-2025714/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/xtransfer-pioneering-ai-driven-transformation-in-b2b-foreign-trade-payment-2025714/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the era of global economic integration, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) face both unprecedented challenges and exciting new opportunities.&nbsp;<b>XTransfer</b>,&nbsp;<b>the World's Leading &amp; China's No.1 B2B Cross-Border Trade Payment Platform</b>, is empowering over 700,000 SMEs across more than 200 countries with innovative financial solutions. The company's relentless pursuit of technological advancement, especially in artificial intelligence (AI), is redefining the standards of risk control and digital transformation in the foreign trade finance industry.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpgbf80left"><img align="middle" alt="XTransfer supports global SMEs with secure and seamless cross-border payments." id="prnejpgbf80left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2730047/XTransfer_photo1.jpg" title="XTransfer supports global SMEs with secure and seamless cross-border payments." /></div>
<p><b>TradePilot: The First Large Language Model in Foreign Trade Finance</b></p>
<p>At the core of XTransfer's innovation is TradePilot, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for the global foreign trade financial sector. Starting development in 2023, TradePilot was designed to leverage cutting-edge AI technologies, such as multimodal information extraction, long-context processing, and AI agents, to address the unique complexities of B2B international trade.</p>
<p>TradePilot's journey has been marked by rapid iteration and real-world validation. In June 2024, two versions of TradePilot outperformed both domestic and international LLMs, including GPT-4, in a professional knowledge assessment, winning first place. This achievement highlights not only XTransfer's technical prowess but also the rising maturity of China's AI ecosystem in mission-critical financial applications.</p>
<p><b>Enhancing Risk Control and Anti-Money Laundering</b></p>
<p>One of the most significant applications of AI at XTransfer is in risk management, particularly anti-money laundering (AML) controls. B2B cross-border trade introduces data challenges, transactions are often fragmented, unstandardized, and partially offline, making it hard to monitor and assess risks. Traditional banks, reliant on manual AML checks, have struggled to efficiently serve SMEs due to high costs and operational inefficiencies.</p>
<p>XTransfer's solution is a data-driven, automated AML risk control infrastructure, powered by TradePilot. By transforming unstructured business and transaction data into structured, analyzable formats, TradePilot enables precise risk prediction and real-time anomaly detection. For example, the system can flag suspicious export patterns that deviate from a country's industrial profile or automatically match buyer and seller information across various documents, such as proforma invoices and logistics papers, enhancing both compliance and operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The results speak for themselves: what once required laborious manual intervention can now be handled at scale, allowing banks and financial institutions to serve SMEs with the same rigour and security as multinational corporations. This boosts financial inclusion and levels the playing field for smaller businesses in global trade.</p>
<p><b>Intelligent Customer Service and Digital Empowerment</b></p>
<p>Beyond risk control, AI infuses every side of XTransfer's product ecosystem. The company's intelligent customer relationship management (CRM) system leverages TradePilot for enhanced semantic understanding, emotion recognition, and effective response generation. Since integrating TradePilot, XTransfer's AI-driven customer service resolution rate has soared from 13% to over 84%, dramatically improving user satisfaction and operational scale.</p>
<p>XTransfer's CRM also features AI-powered tools such as multilingual letter writing, instant website building, and the pioneering "AI Employee" service. These innovations help SMEs with limited technical or language resources to efficiently reach global buyers, manage operations, and establish an online presence, in as little as 30 seconds. Over 10,000 foreign trade businesses have already benefited from these services, lowering the barriers to digital adoption and accelerating their international growth.</p>
<p><b>Commitment to Data Security and Future Outlook</b></p>
<p>XTransfer's technological architecture is built on robust, distributed computing principles, ensuring high performance and reliability. The company adheres strictly to international and regional laws regarding data privacy, employing encryption, access controls, and audit mechanisms to safeguard user data.</p>
<p>Looking forward, XTransfer aims further to promote the adoption of its AI-powered TradePilot model, thereby accelerating the digital transformation of the B2B foreign trade finance sector.&nbsp;<b>Weitong Li, Senior Technology Director of XTransfer,&nbsp;</b>emphasises that the successful deployment of TradePilot is both a testament to XTransfer's innovation and a catalyst for smarter, safer, and more accessible global trade.</p>
<p>As foreign trade becomes increasingly intelligent and data-driven, XTransfer stands at the forefront, empowering SMEs to explore broader markets and seize new opportunities in the evolving global economy.</p>

<title>First Moore Global Thrive Index Shows Mid-Market Upbeat - 2,000-Plus Business Leaders Surveyed Show Resounding Optimism On Economic Prospects</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Moore Global, the global accounting, audit, and advisory network, has launched the Thrive Index, a unique insight into the concerns and strategic thinking of leaders of ambitious businesses across the world.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg60f2left"><img align="middle" alt="Moore Global Logo" id="prnejpg60f2left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2727850/5412158/Moore_Global_Logo.jpg" title="Moore Global Logo" /></div>
<p>This first edition of the Thrive Index revealed that the mid-market companies that form the backbone of the global economy are generally upbeat about the future, despite confusion over tariffs and ongoing geopolitical tensions.</p>
<p>Moore Global surveyed more than 2,000 business leaders across 14 of the world's most important economies on five key areas: general sentiment about the business environment; revenue; costs; the labour market and investment.</p>
<p>The Thrive Index scores capture the balance of positive responses minus the balance of negative responses. It is scored on a scale from -100, representing unanimous negativity, to +100, representing unanimous positivity.</p>
<p>The score for the first Thrive Index is +35.1, indicating positivity among the leaders of mid-market businesses. Almost 75% of those surveyed improved business performance last year.</p>
<p>The highest score was recorded in India, at +48.7, driven by particularly strong reports of revenue, headcount and investment growth. By contrast, four of the five lowest scores were in the European Union, reflecting the slow growth outlook for the bloc.</p>
<p>In terms of business sectors, IT showed the highest score (+44.2) while wholesale trade was the laggard at +17.6. However, when wholesalers look ahead over the coming year, their sentiment is much more positive, particularly on revenue and employment expectations.</p>
<p>Anton Colella, Moore Global CEO, said: "Our findings are fascinating and illustrate the agility of ambitious mid-market business leaders. They are investing more in people and technology to gain an advantage in challenging economic conditions."</p>

<title>AuditBoard And Deloitte Join Forces: New Alliance Offers Individual Support And Tailored GRC Solutions For Joint Clients</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>AuditBoard, the leading global platform for networked risk management and transformation in the areas of audit, risk and compliance, is expanding its partnership with Deloitte. As a result, joint clients will receive targeted local support to make their work processes more efficient, fulfil regulatory requirements and gain valuable insights into their audit and risk processes.</p>
<p>As part of AuditBoard's recent market entry in Germany, Deloitte Germany is establishing a Centre of Excellence to support the implementation of AuditBoard solutions and provide immediate added value to clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The certified team will provide specialised training, resources, content and tailored consulting tailored to the specific requirements in Germany and beyond.</p>
<p>The partnership comes at a time when organisations are increasingly turning to AI-centric platforms such as AuditBoard to boost the productivity of their teams. In global internal audit and GRC functions in particular, manual processes lead to significant efficiency losses. According to a survey of 232 German audit managers, 66 per cent plan their audits at least partially manually, which makes it difficult to optimally allocate resources and react quickly to new risks. Over two-thirds of respondents also rely on manual or partially manual reporting processes, which limit the timeliness and analytical depth of risk reporting for company management.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The expanded alliance comes at just the right time to help organisations transform their audit and risk processes,&rsquo; explains&nbsp;<b>Bert Glorieux, Partner at Deloitte Germany</b>. &lsquo;With Deloitte's extensive industry experience and AuditBoard's innovative technology, German clients can optimise their governance, risk and compliance processes, realise efficiency gains and achieve better business results.&rsquo;</p>
<p><b>Ravi Patel, Director of Alliances, EMEA, at AuditBoard</b>, added: "This collaboration builds on the success of the Deloitte and AuditBoard partnership to date, which has delivered successful implementations and measurable results for hundreds of major clients. Together, we will deliver sustainable value to our clients in Germany and promote excellence in audit and compliance."</p>
<p>AuditBoard's growth is based in part on the success of AuditBoard AI, an intelligent solution that supports advanced workflows in audit, risk and compliance. These features allow teams to save valuable time and focus on the most strategic issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>87% of firms have boosted cloud spending in the past two years.</li>
<li>82% use hybrid/multi-cloud</li>
<li>91% are advancing AI via cloud</li>
</ul>

<td class="body">
<p>Financial services firms around the world are accelerating their adoption of cloud technologies to enhance agility, resilience, and innovation, not merely to reduce costs, according to new research conducted by LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group).</p>
<p>The global survey of 453 financial services executives reveals that 87% of firms have increased their investment in cloud over the past two years, with a growing emphasis on strategic outcomes such as scalability, revenue growth, and AI enablement.</p>
<p>The research shows that 82% of firms now operate with either a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy, reflecting a shift toward flexibility and risk diversification. However, this evolution is not without its challenges. 84% of respondents have had to adjust their cloud strategies in response to regulatory frameworks such as the EU&rsquo;s Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Brown, Group Head of Data &amp; Feeds,&nbsp;</strong><strong>LSEG:</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The results of our survey show that adopting cloud is no longer a technology or engineering led decision; it is a key business imperative. Companies are increasingly driving meaningful value from cloud, improving operational resilience, and preparing for the next wave of innovation. Over the next three years, that innovation will be driven by AI and machine learning, with financial institutions increasingly using cloud to power fraud detection, risk management, data analytics and generative AI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Security remains a top concern. Nearly half of respondents (47%) cite the sophistication of cyberattacks as their primary worry, followed closely by concerns around data privacy and breaches. Despite this, 92% say operational resilience is a critical or very important factor when selecting a cloud provider underscoring the importance of trust and reliability in cloud partnerships.</p>
<p>Firms are seeing tangible benefits from cloud adoption. 54% of respondents report that they have migrated and are already seeing value, particularly in areas like risk management, customer engagement, and enterprise data access. For instance, 83% of firms using cloud for risk management have already completed migration, the highest among all use cases.</p>
<p>Interestingly, ROI is increasingly measured by strategic outcomes: 51% assess cloud success by scalability, 47% by revenue growth, and 47% by improved security and resilience. Only 34% prioritize immediate cost savings signaling a shift in how cloud value is perceived.</p>
<p>That said, 61% of firms still report reduced IT infrastructure costs, especially in regions like EMEA and APAC, where multi-cloud strategies are more prevalent due to regulatory complexity.</p>
<p>The survey found that 91% of firms are either already using or planning to use cloud services for AI initiatives within the next 12 months. Generative AI (60%), fraud detection (50%), and risk management (50%) are the top use cases. Moreover, 84% of respondents say their organizations are somewhat or very advanced in AI adoption, with investment firms leading the way.</p>
<p>As firms look to the future, many are also reconsidering their cloud service models. While SaaS remains dominant today (43%), there is growing interest in Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), a sign that firms may be preparing to build more bespoke applications in-house.</p>

<title>Digital Assets Breakthrough: Aberdeen Investments, Lloyds Banking Group And Archax Complete Uk-First Use Of Digital Assets</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li><strong>Landmark collaboration underscores the UK&rsquo;s capability to become a global hub for digital asset innovation</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Lloyds Banking Group (Lloyds), Aberdeen Investments, and Archax today announce a landmark collaboration of their trading businesses to advance the use of cutting edge blockchain technology using tokenised real-world assets (RWAs) as collateral.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a UK-first initiative, tokenised units of Aberdeen Investment&rsquo;s money market fund (tMMF) and tokenised UK gilts were used as collateral for foreign exchange (FX) trades between Aberdeen and Lloyds. These digital tokens were issued, transferred, and securely held by Archax - a UK FCA-regulated digital asset exchange - on the Hedera Hashgraph public permissioned blockchain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UK trades $5.4 trillion in FX and interest rate derivatives daily, accounting for half of global activity. This trade demonstrates that regulated digital assets can serve as collateral in this market, which is a significant milestone. Digital assets can be programmed to automatically follow the rules of trading agreements streamlining the margining process, reducing operational costs, enhancing collateral efficiency, and minimising counterparty risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wider adoption of tokenised funds as collateral could also help reduce systemic risk during periods of market stress by enabling digital transfers instead of forced asset sales&mdash;thereby reducing volatility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This collaboration between two of the UK&rsquo;s largest financial institutions and a homegrown regulated fintech marks a major step forward in digital finance. The successful pilot lays the foundation for scaling tokenised collateral solutions, reinforcing the UK&rsquo;s leadership in next-generation financial infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Emily Smart, Chief Product Officer, Aberdeen Investments</strong>&nbsp;says: &ldquo;Tokenisation has long been seen as a key enabler in the new world of digital innovation. That&rsquo;s why we are delighted to collaborate with Lloyds and Archax, to demonstrate real-world application of on chain collateral movements using tokenised assets. This demonstrates the ability of digital assets to streamline processes and increase efficiency.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Peter Left, Head of Digital Finance at Lloyds Banking Group</strong>, said: &ldquo;This groundbreaking initiative proves that digital assets can be used in regulated financial markets under existing legal frameworks here in the UK. It&rsquo;s a major step forward in demonstrating how tokenisation can enhance collateral efficiency, reduce friction, and unlock new trading opportunities.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Graham Rodford, CEO and co-founder of Archax</strong>, adds: &ldquo;This latest use-case for Nest, our permissioned DeFi collateral transfer network, highlights the power of regulated digital infrastructure to support institutional-grade needs. We&rsquo;re excited to be partnering with Lloyds and Aberdeen on this initiative and look forward to scaling the use of tokenised RWAs as transferable collateral. This has established another key digital milestone in the foundation for a more open and efficient financial system.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Access to the South Korean market with USD-denominated futures contracts on the MSCI Korea Net Total Return Index starting on 14 July.</li>
<li>Korea accounts for nearly 11 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index, making it an important market for international institutional investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Eurex, one of the world&rsquo;s leading derivatives exchanges and part of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, announces the launch of Futures on the MSCI Korea Index. With this launch Eurex provides efficient and cost-effective access to the Korean equity market, supporting international investors diversifying exposures worldwide on a single venue. Trading will start on 14 July 2025.</p>
<p>Eurex is currently the only derivatives exchange outside of Korea offering access to a Korean equity index.&nbsp; As of 30 June 2025, Korea accounts for 10.73 percent of the MSCI Emerging Markets (EM) Index, ranking as the fourth-largest country allocation in the index, which captures large- and mid-cap representation across 24 EM countries.</p>
<p>The launch follows the conclusion of the clearing link between Eurex and KRX (Korea Exchange). While previously focused on KOSPI derivatives largely utilized by retail investors and market makers, the new Futures on the MSCI Korea Index cater specifically to the needs of international institutional investors. These are mainly asset managers and asset owners, as well as banks, seeking US-dollar denominated exposure to the Korean market within the MSCI framework, enhancing trading and margin efficiencies.</p>
<p>Ralf Huesmann, heading product design for MSCI Derivatives at Eurex: &ldquo;As global leader in MSCI derivatives we now added a last major piece in the puzzle of our MSCI offering with the goal to cover all Developed and Emerging Markets globally. This allows global investors to trade all these markets with the same index methodology, similar contract specifications and bundled in one clearing house to be highly margin efficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>George Harrington, Global Head of Fixed Income &amp; Derivatives at MSCI: &ldquo;We are pleased to collaborate with Eurex on its launch of the first futures contract linked to the MSCI Korea Index. Designed to represent the performance of large- and mid-cap segments of the Korean market, this index suite is broadly used by institutional investors worldwide as a benchmark for Korean equity exposure. Its integration into index-linked instruments underscores the critical role that transparent and rules-based index methodologies play in supporting informed and efficient global investment decisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eurex lists already futures on 41 out of 47 countries, which are either classified as Developed or Emerging Markets by MSCI. With the addition of Korea, Eurex offers country futures on any market with a weighting of above 1 percent in either the MSCI World Index or the MSCI EM Index.</p>
<p>Currently, Eurex offers 146 MSCI futures, with approximately half of the trading volume focusing on the Asia-Pacific region. This regional focus is also mirrored in open interest, where 45 percent of the total open interest worth EUR 135 billion are linked to Asian underlyings.</p>

<div class="lead text-sm md:text-base font-bold max-w-[49rem] xl:max-w-[53rem] !leading-normal">
<p><a href="https://www.signicat.com/">Signicat</a>, the leading pan-European digital identity platform, has today announced its acquisition of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.inverid.com/">Inverid</a>, the pioneering Dutch provider of NFC-based digital identity verification solutions, for an undisclosed sum&nbsp;from majority shareholder Main Capital and the founders. Existing shareholders will reinvest a substantial part of the consideration in Signicat, underlying their strong support of the combination.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="ml-8 md:ml-10 mr-8 md:mr-10 lg:mr-0 lg:pr-12 col-right">
<div class="rtf text-sm md:text-base">
<p>The acquisition strengthens Signicat&rsquo;s offering with Inverid&rsquo;s flagship solution, ReadID, which has set the global standard for NFC-based identity document verification. Similarly, this integration supports Signicat's commitment to remain at the forefront of innovation. Signicat and Inverid have immediate synergies at both technological and commercial levels, as well as a strong cultural fit.</p>
<p>First launched in 2014, ReadID was the world&rsquo;s first NFC-based mobile identity verification solution, providing a high level of assurance and reliability for sectors requiring rigorous identity checks. Inverid&rsquo;s client list spans both public and private sectors, including governments, financial institutions, and border control authorities.</p>
<p>ReadID offers unparalleled capabilities in NFC-based document verification and holds industry-recognised certifications such as ISO27001, ISO27701, SOC2 Type II, and eIDAS Level of Assurance High. Trusted by over 50 organisations, including Rabobank, the UK and Danish governments, and the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex), ReadID enables organisations to perform secure, efficient, and scalable identity verification processes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past three years, with the backing of Main Capital, Inverid has made substantial investments in both R&amp;D - marked by the opening of a dedicated hub in Valencia - and in strengthening its go-to-market capabilities. As a result, the company has secured key industry tenders, tripled its revenue, and increased profitability fourfold.</p>
<p>Signicat has heavily expanded its European footprint over the last years through large organic investments in development of new products, but also through eight strategic bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen its proprietary technology, customer base, and market expertise. Inverid joins a platform which includes other industry-leading solutions such as high-security app-based mobile authentication, unparalleled eIDAS-compliant video-based identity verification solutions, the world&rsquo;s by far largest hub of national eIDs, and leading anti-fraud orchestration solutions like RiskFlow and Mint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>By adding Inverid&rsquo;s unique NFC-based solution to our platform, we can offer our customers the best possible document verification technology and unmatched identity solutions</i>&rdquo; comments Asger Hattel, CEO of Signicat. &ldquo;<i>This transaction demonstrates our commitment to remaining at the forefront of digital identity innovation, constantly striving to offer our customers still more effective tools to fight fraud while improving digitization journeys for their end users</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>The acquisition of Inverid is an important step to further strengthen Signicat&rsquo;s offering to deliver even better digital identity solutions to the market. Building on a successful partnership between the companies and a strong cultural fit, this transaction will unlock immediate synergies. Nordic Capital is enthusiastic about supporting Signicat&rsquo;s continued growth journey in Europe</i>&rdquo;, said Rolf Tors&oslash;e, Managing Director at Nordic Capital Advisors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>We share the same culture and European foundations, creating an excellent proposition, also in the context of the coming European Identity Wallet developments</i>&rdquo;, states Maarten Wegdam, co-founder and CEO of Inverid. &ldquo;<i>The identity verification market is moving more towards integrated and secure solutions. By combining our identity verification technology with Signicat&rsquo;s global platform and unique identity and orchestration solutions, we can support that growing market perfectly</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Charly Zwemstra, CEO of Main Capital and Chairman of the Supervisory Board of Inverid, adds: &ldquo;<i>We are excited to announce this next step in the growth strategy of Inverid. Since our investment in 2022, the business has taken great strides in its internationalization strategy while sustaining its reputation as world class pioneer in the field of NFC-based identity verification technology. We look back on a great partnership, are firmly convinced about the benefits of this strategic combination, and look forward to stay involved with this partnership following our reinvestment as a minority owner in Signicat</i>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This acquisition underscores Signicat&rsquo;s ambition to lead the digital identity ecosystem by providing customers with high-assurance solutions perfectly tailored to address today&rsquo;s challenges. For financial institutions, public services, or any organisation navigating stringent compliance and security standards, the integration of Inverid into Signicat&rsquo;s portfolio complements their state-of-the-art, secure, and scalable identity verification solutions.</p>

<title>Press Conference By KATO Katsunobu, Japan Minister Of Finance And Minister Of State For Financial Services - 25th Anniversary Of The Establishment Of The Financial Services Agency</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>(Excerpt)</p>
<p>(Tuesday, July&nbsp;1, 2025, 11:19&nbsp;am to 11:28&nbsp;am)</p>
<h4 class="navihidden">[Opening remarks:]</h4>
<dl class="qanda2"><dt class="ans char2">Minister)</dt><dd>
<p>First, I would like to say a few words on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the Financial Services Agency.<br />Today marks the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the FSA, which was formed through the merger of the former Financial Supervisory Agency and the Financial System Planning Bureau of the Ministry of Finance.<br />I would like to express our sincere gratitude to persons concerned for their understanding and cooperation in financial administration.<br />The mission of the FSA is as stated in the document distributed to you, namely to enhance national welfare, and the priorities of the administration have changed with the times. Looking back, 25 years ago when the FSA was established, the priority was to stabilize the financial system by restoring trust in financial administration and resolving non-performing loans.<br />On the other hand, although Japan&rsquo;s financial system is generally stable at present, it faces uncertainty in domestic and overseas economic and financial markets and structural changes in the economy and society as the transition to a &ldquo;world with interest rates&rdquo; progresses.<br />In addition, amid a trend of population decline and aging, strengthening &ldquo;regional financial capacity&rdquo; to support regional economies is also a very important issue. By the end of this year, we will formulate and strongly promote a plan to strengthen regional financial capacity, which packages related measures.<br />Furthermore, in recent years, financial services and transactions utilizing digital technologies such as AI and blockchain have been rapidly expanding, and we believe that the areas in which the FSA is expected to play a role are also expanding.<br />Supporting these diverse financial sectors from an administrative perspective is precisely the mission of the FSA. To fulfill this mission, the Agency and all of its staff will continue to make every effort. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in financial administration.</p>
</dd></dl>
<h4>[Questions and answers:]</h4>
<dl class="qanda"><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>This question relates to the FSA&rsquo;s organizational restructuring. I understand that there are moves to integrate the Monitoring Division, formerly the Inspection Bureau, and the Supervision Bureau. Please explain the purpose and positioning of these moves.</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>The monitoring of major banks, which has been conducted under the Director-General of the Strategy Development and Management Bureau, will be transferred to the Supervision Bureau.<br />Specifically, monitoring of major banks will be conducted in conjunction with supervision, led by Banking Business Division I of the Supervision Bureau. In addition, we plan to monitor specialized cross-cutting themes such as money laundering and conduct risks under the supervision of the Director-General of the Supervision Bureau, with the Vice Commissioner for Strategy Development and Management directing and coordinating the efforts of each division in order to ensure more integrated and effective operations. In terms of supervision and monitoring, coordination is essential, starting with the sharing of issues. Therefore, under the direction of the Director-General of the Supervision Bureau, we intend to review the current system with a view to ensuring more integrated operations and deeper coordination among relevant bureaus, including dialogue with individual financial institutions, so that supervision and monitoring can be made more effective and efficient.</p>
</dd><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>Starting today, a new department called the Asset Management Business Division will be established within the FSA. Please share your current assessment of the status of Japan&rsquo;s initiatives toward becoming a leading asset management center, as well as your expectations for the role of the Division.</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>The Asset Management Business Division is currently working on expanding the NISA program as part of initiatives toward becoming a leading asset management center.<br />At the same time, we are also promoting financial and economic education consecutively. In order to further promote these initiatives, we have established the Division to take the lead in these efforts. We expect it to play a central role in promoting the shift from savings to investment in Japan.</p>
</dd><dt>Q.</dt><dd>
<p>You mentioned the changing role of the FSA. When it was first established, its main focus was on the disposal of non-performing loans, and at that time it was often mockingly referred to as the Financial Punishment Agency. In recent years, as former Minister Aso mentioned, there has been talk of establishing a Financial Nurturing Agency. Considering the future role of the FSA, what do you think it should strive for? Also, if you were to give it a name, what would you call it?</p>
</dd><dt class="ans">A.</dt><dd>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we have been addressing the issues of each era, and 25 years ago, the financial situation at that time was, in a sense, very unstable. I believe that addressing non-performing loans was an urgent issue, and recently, as we have been working to stabilize such issues one by one, the Bank of Japan has begun to raise interest rates and reduce its purchases of government bonds. In light of these changes in policy, the FSA will continue to provide strong support to ensure that the necessary roles are fulfilled. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, new fields such as AI, blockchain, and digital technologies are expanding significantly, and the number of people involved in these fields is growing not only among traditional financial institutions but also among non-financial institutions. In this expanding environment, I believe that the FSA will be required to consider how to build a stable financial system as a whole.<br />While it is difficult to assign a name to this, I believe that a name will be historically established as we overcome these challenges.</p>

<title>New Zealand Financial Markets Authority: Review Of Access To Financial Advice For New Zealand</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To enhance our understanding of the availability of financial advice in New Zealand, including where consumers go to get advice, we are undertaking a review focusing on challenges and opportunities related to access to financial advice.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Since the new financial advice regime came into effect in 2021, monitoring has helped us understand how quality and accessibility of advice work together. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Our view is quality and accessibility are complementary but can also have trade-offs. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Ensuring consumers can access quality financial advice when they need it is crucial. We know there are many positive impacts on consumers who receive good quality financial advice. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />This review will help us understand opportunities and challenges in relation to consumer access to financial advice. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />What we learn from this review will inform our areas of regulatory focus, including deciding what further work we may need to undertake in our role of monitoring the regime and ensuring it is fulfilling its purpose. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We plan to publish any relevant insights and engage with the market on our findings. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />We will aim to share constructive insights that may highlight opportunities for improvement, for individual financial advice providers or the sector as a whole. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Where we identify issues that are having undesirable impacts on access to financial advice, we will consider the best steps to address these. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This could include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>issuing new guidance &nbsp;</li>
<li>evolving our monitoring focus &nbsp;</li>
<li>making recommendations if we identify gaps or potential improvements that need to be addressed, or improving consumer awareness. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Insights from our review will help ensure we take appropriate actions to improve outcomes both for consumers and the financial advice industry, and that the financial advice regime succeeds in improving the availability of quality financial advice.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I extend my sincere congratulations to Jonathan Gould, who will soon become the 32<span>nd</span>&nbsp;Comptroller of the Currency. Mr. Gould will be the first confirmed Comptroller of the Currency since Joseph Otting departed in 2020.</p>

<p>It has been my honor to lead the OCC during these past five months while Mr. Gould&rsquo;s nomination has been pending. I look forward to supporting a smooth leadership transition so that Comptroller Gould can continue to build on the agency&rsquo;s significant progress improving the safety, soundness, and fairness of the federal banking system.</p>

<title>Closer Links With Ukraine: ACER-NEURC (Ukrainian Regulator) Workshop In Ljubljana</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, ACER hosted the Ukrainian energy regulator, NEURC, for a closed workshop on regulatory issues.</p>
<p>ACER Director, Christian Pilgaard Zinglersen, welcomed Mr Yuriy Vlasenko, NEURC Chairman, and Mr Oleksandr Formagei, Commissioner at NEURC, to ACER&rsquo;s headquarters in Ljubljana, Slovenia.</p>
<p>The regulatory discussion focused on 3 energy issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ukraine&rsquo;s integration into the EU electricity market;</li>
<li>gas market developments and challenges; and</li>
<li>implementation of REMIT (the EU framework that seeks to prevent market manipulation and abuse on wholesale energy markets) in Ukraine.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Ukrainian regulator also spoke to the extensive damage done to energy infrastructure by Russian attacks - this making their simultaneous commitment to enact EU regulatory reforms all the more impressive.</p>
<p>The area of energy remains a key focus area, both during the current war in Ukraine and for post-war economic recovery. In February this year, the European Commission committed to Ukraine&rsquo;s accelerated EU membership with a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAVcEUldTAkwBBgYFHVYAAgUdUAwDVBpUBAQPBwBQUgYEBgYdA1FVWQpSAlEdUFoBUB0GCAIDGlRVV1UZAlMFUFNQB1hTUVBXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">new package of support</a>&nbsp;for energy security and Ukraine&rsquo;s EU energy market integration.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, in Brussels, Ukraine completed its pre-accession screening process with the European Commission on energy issues and trans-European networks. This marks a key milestone of Ukraine&rsquo;s fast-track path to EU membership.</p>
<p>Meanwhile this week, in Rome, at the Ukraine Recovery Conference, European Commission President&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtUAFVUVARWBkxaBAdRHVYNDQEdCwxSUxoDBANVUFYHAlNVAVIdA1FVWQpSAlEdUFoBUB0GCAIDGlRVV1UZAlMFUFNQB1hTUVBXRQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ursula von der Leyen unveiled a new &euro;2.3 billion package</a>&nbsp;of agreements with international and bilateral public financial institutions to support Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction efforts. The conference pointed to strengthening Ukrainian institutions and promoting long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>ACER&rsquo;s workshop today in Ljubljana, technical in nature and focused on core energy regulatory issues, is yet another example of the EU&rsquo;s steadfast commitment to Ukraine's future in the EU. It follows ACER&rsquo;s recent visit (in May) to Kyiv and an earlier ACER workshop dedicated to NEURC in October 2023.</p>
<p>NEURC called for further collaboration with ACER to strengthen its capacity and help get ready for its EU-based future.</p>
<p>ACER Director, Christian Zinglersen, confirmed &ldquo;ACER is fully committed to collaborate with our Ukrainian colleagues as they accelerate regulatory reforms and enhance their human, technical and IT capacities. We all know the end destination (EU membership)&nbsp;and ACER wants to do its bit to enable this sooner rather than later."</p>

<title>U.S. Department Of The Treasury: Statement On The President’s Decision Prohibiting The Acquisition By Suirui Group Co., Ltd. Of Jupiter Systems, LLC</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Today, President Trump published an order prohibiting the acquisition by Suirui International Co., Limited, a Hong Kong company that is majority owned by Suirui Group Co., Ltd. (Suirui), a company organized under the laws of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China, of Jupiter Systems, LLC (Jupiter), a Delaware company (subsequently converted into Jupiter Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS or the Committee) reviewed and investigated this transaction pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended (Section 721).&nbsp; CFIUS identified a national security risk arising from Suirui&rsquo;s ownership of Jupiter relating to the potential compromise of Jupiter&rsquo;s products used in military and critical infrastructure environments.&nbsp; To address this risk, the President&rsquo;s order directs Suirui to divest all interests and rights in Jupiter and requires that Jupiter hold no interest or rights in any assets or operations of its Chinese subsidiaries acquired or created after the completion of the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CFIUS process focuses exclusively on identifying and addressing national security concerns arising from a covered transaction on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp; This focused mandate reinforces CFIUS&rsquo;s commitment to welcoming foreign investment while protecting national security.&nbsp;</p>

<p><section class="rich-text">
<div class="field field--name-text field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched three public consultations on Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) and Guidelines (GL) on third-country branches under the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) concerning booking arrangements, capital endowment and supervisory colleges. These regulatory products aim at ensuring a harmonised and consistent implementation of the new EU framework for third-country branches, enhancing comparability across Member States, and fostering effective supervisory cooperation. The three consultations run until 10 October 2025.&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The draft RTS specifying the booking arrangements</span>&nbsp;lay down the methodology to identify and record assets and liabilities booked or originated by the third-country branch, as well as off-balance sheet items. They also outline the minimum content of the registry book and information on risks to be maintained. The RTS aim to ensure convergence of third-country branches&rsquo; practices regarding the implementation of booking arrangements and the maintenance of the registry book.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The draft GLs on instruments for the capital endowment</span>&nbsp;include the list of instruments that third-country branches can use - in addition to cash and debt securities issued by central governments or central banks of Member States - to meet their capital endowment requirement and specify minimum operational conditions that third-country branches should respect in order to ensure that the capital endowment instruments serve their purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>The draft RTS on cooperation between competent authorities supervising third-country branches</span>&nbsp;aim to facilitate and support competent authorities in cooperating and exchanging information relating to third-country branches in going concern and emergency situations. They also provide practical modalities for organising colleges of supervisors for third-country branches to ensure that all activities of the third-country group in the Union are subject to comprehensive supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Consultation process&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>Comments on the three consultations can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the &ldquo;send your comments&rdquo; button on the respective consultation pages. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 10 October 2025. All contributions received will be published after the consultation closes, unless requested otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-consultation-papers-third-country-branch-related-crdvi-mandates-rts-booking" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">public hearing</span></a><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span>on all three regulatory products will take place on 3 September from 10:00 to 12:00 CEST. The deadline for registration is the 1 September 2025, 12:00 CEST.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Legal basis&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>The EBA has developed the draft RTS on booking arrangements in accordance with Article 48h of Directive 2013/36/EU, pursuant to which TCBs should maintain a registry book to track and keep a record of the assets and liabilities associated with their activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The draft GL on instruments for the capital endowment have been developed in accordance with Article 48e of Directive 2013/36/EU, requiring TCBs to maintain, at all times, a minimum capital endowment deposited in an escrow account, which shall be available in the case of resolution or winding-up of the TCB.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The draft RTS on cooperation between competent authorities supervising TCBs have been developed in accordance with Article 48p(7) of Directive 2013/36/EU to specify the effective cooperation and exchange of information between competent authorities supervising institutions and branches of the same third-country group and the conditions for the functioning of colleges of supervisors for class 1 TCBs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4>Background and next steps&nbsp;</h4>
</div>
<div>
<p>Directive (EU) 2024/1619, amending Directive 2013/36/EU, introduces a new regime applicable to branches in the EU of third country credit institutions (third country branches or TCBs). It lays down a minimum harmonisation framework covering authorisation, prudential requirements &ndash; including booking arrangements, capital endowment, liquidity, internal governance, common reporting requirements - and supervisory practices.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The updated Guidelines on internal governance and those on supervisory review and evaluation process (SREP) for credit institutions will include a separate section on third-country branches related aspects.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<title>EACH’s Women In Clearing Series – Getting inspired By Babett Pavlics, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), KELER CCP</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/eachs-women-in-clearing-series-getting-inspired-by-babett-pavlics-chief-exec-2025711/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Following the successful launch of the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12789353/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><b>Women in Clearing Network</b></a>,<b>&nbsp;</b>in March 2024 the&nbsp;<b>EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series&nbsp;</b>was inaugurated. This is an initiative with the objective of featuring a key female leader on a regular basis to inspire other professionals in the industry.<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This month&rsquo;s inspiration comes from&nbsp;<b>Babett Pavlics, Chief Executive Officer (CEO), KELER CCP</b>.&nbsp;Babett spent the first 20 years of her carrier in the banking sector. She worked all together 10 &ndash; 10 years for Raiffeisen Group and UniCredit. Her expertise in banking covers securities services, transactional banking, investment products and client segment management in Financial Institutional clientele. She became the CEO of KELER CCP in March 2020. Within EACH she is a co-chair of the Energy Clearing Working Group.</p>
<p>Babett has volunteered to share with us her personal and professional journey by responding to three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What was the aspect of yourself that you had to work on the most to get to where you are now?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>When I reflect on my journey to where I am today, the most significant aspect I had to learn was the courage to truly recognise my own strengths and competitive skills. Early in my career, like many women, I believed that exceptional results would speak for themselves. My focus was always on delivering, pushing harder in the background, and trusting that my capabilities would naturally lead to recognition and promotion. However, I soon realized that in leadership, it's not enough to simply produce. You must also actively participate, share your vision, and proudly put your achievements in the spotlight. So learning to confidently 'sit in the middle of the table' and proudly share my impact was the first thing to learn.</p>
<p>Another crucial internal barrier I had to overstep was social pressure, or perhaps some internal belief, that having a family might mean compromising my career aspirations. I'm very proud to say that I've built a fulfilling career while raising two wonderful children. This journey taught me that success isn't about choosing one over the other, but about redefining what 'having it all' means for you. This leads to the third, and perhaps most important lesson: the absolute necessity of building strong, supportive teams, not just professionally but personally. I learned to get rid of the idea that I had to do everything myself. Embracing the power of true partnership &ndash; whether it's empowering my colleagues or having a robust support system at home &ndash; has been transformative.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What key tip would you give for professionals to successfully develop in their careers?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>For professionals looking to truly succeed, my key tip is two-fold. Firstly, recognise your firm's critical moments and be ready to deliver beyond expectations. Promotions aren't just about meeting targets; they're earned by going that 'extra mile' when something extraordinary is happening. Be proactive, offer solutions, and ensure your unique contribution is visible when it truly matters. Secondly, embrace Jim Collins' advice: 'get the right people on the bus.' It is not only about management. In every project and collaborative task, actively identify, empower, and build teams with the best individuals. Your ability to surround yourself with excellence and building on collective strengths will be the most powerful accelerator for your own career.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>How do you see the future of clearing in 10 years?</b></li>
</ul>
<p>The last decade was Looking ahead 10 years, I see the future of clearing, particularly in CEE, as one of deepened integration, increased sophistication, and continued resilience, with technology as a key enabler.</p>
<p>I believe that both in capital and energy market the relevance of clearing houses will only grow. The drive for energy market coupling across Europe means that the efficient and secure clearing of physical and financial energy products will be inevitable. I anticipate:</p>
<p>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enhanced Connectivity: Clearing houses will become even more interconnected, supporting seamless cross-border trading and netting efficiencies across the CEE region and with Western Europe.</p>
<p>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;Broader Product Scope: I anticipate an expansion into clearing a wider list of energy-related products, including those emerging from the green transition like guarantees of origin or capacity products.</p>
<p>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technological Advancement: AI, blockchain, and advanced analytics will further automate processes, enhance risk modelling, and enable real-time insights, making clearing even more robust and efficient. This also includes improved data sharing and regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>&sect;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resilience and Stability: Post-crisis lessons emphasize the need for robust risk management. CCPs will remain central to maintaining financial stability, acting as critical shock absorbers in an increasingly volatile capital and energy landscape<span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>We are immensely grateful to Babett for her enlightening and enriching contribution and we look forward to continuing the EACH&rsquo;s Women in Clearing Series by hosting many skilled women leaders to inspire other professionals in the clearing sector!</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, issued today a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-07/ESMA35-1872330276-2329_-_MiCA_Statement_Access_to_Unregulated_Activities.pdf">public statement</a>&nbsp;warning investors of the &lsquo;halo effect&rsquo; that can lead to overlooking risk when authorised crypto-asset service providers (CASP&rsquo;s) offer both regulated and unregulated products and/or services.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The statement also reminds CASPs of the issues that they should consider when providing unregulated products and services, recommending that they should be particularly vigilant about avoiding any client confusion regarding the protections attached to unregulated products and/or services.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>To avoid any misunderstanding CASPs should clearly communicate the regulatory status of each product or service in all client interactions and at every stage of the sales process.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>In addition, ESMA reminds crypto-assets entities of their obligation to act fairly, professionally and in the best interests of their clients, ensuring that all information, including marketing communications, is fair, clear and not misleading.</span></p>

<p><span>Background &ndash; FCA&rsquo;s efforts to stimulate the research market post-MiFID II</span></p>
<p><span>In July 2024 the FCA released&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublication%2Fpolicy%2Fps24-9.pdf/1/01020197f8475eb3-7e83c6fe-2d28-461b-ac5f-e385dbda18eb-000000/x3NwFjyrgoxVosQE9a85tszHkOM=434" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>new rules within COBS2</span></a>&nbsp;covering segregated mandates, making it easier for asset managers to pass their external research costs back onto end investors, as they did pre-MiFID II. However, it became clear that for this &ldquo;joint payments&rdquo; option to be broadly taken up in the UK, any new freedoms would need to be extended to include pooled funds. In November 2024 the FCA Consultation Paper (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublications%2Fpolicy-statements%2Fps21-20-changes-uk-mifids-conduct-and-organisational-requirements/1/01020197f8475eb3-7e83c6fe-2d28-461b-ac5f-e385dbda18eb-000000/OPsWc7UDOdpjkclDwgn8EI4LU24=434" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>CP24/21</span></a>) covering Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) and Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) markets, clashed with the previous COBS2 rules by requiring research budgeting at a fund level, which as&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fsubstantiveresearch.com%2Finsights-and-press%2Fasset-managers-push-back-on-the-fcas-fund-level-budgeting-rules-for-investment-research%2F/1/01020197f8475eb3-7e83c6fe-2d28-461b-ac5f-e385dbda18eb-000000/NvAl6l5DeG1q-3byYCOgJuAF_FQ=434" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>Substantive&rsquo;s January survey</span></a>&nbsp;showed, would have been a &lsquo;dealbreaker&rsquo; for many firms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Asset managers have now had eight weeks to digest the FCA&rsquo;s final Policy Statement (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Fpublications%2Fpolicy-statements%2Fps25-4-investment-research-payment-optionality-fund-managers/2/01020197f8475eb3-7e83c6fe-2d28-461b-ac5f-e385dbda18eb-000000/GD9l71UJg2V23d1NGQ6JwY6pwi4=434" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>CP24/9</span></a>) that shows that the FCA has listened to the buy side&rsquo;s concerns, and allowed for both strategy or firm-level budgeting for research.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Substantive Research&rsquo;s latest survey shows clearly how the asset management community will respond to this optionality.</span></p>
<ul>
<li> <span>87% of respondents predict that at least half of all research budgets will become client-funded within the next two years&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>52% said that within two years the majority of research budgets would move to client-funded (vs. 7% previously), with another 35% expecting half of budgets to have moved by then</span> </li>
<li> <span>71% of respondents were supportive of the new joint payments freedoms (vs. 16% supportive in the previous survey in January)</span> </li>
<li> <span>97% of respondents said that the new requirements were workable (vs. 40% previously)</span> </li>
<li> <span>94% of respondents said that the separate EU requirements (similar to the FCA&rsquo;s but less onerous) were workable (vs. 74% previously)</span> </li>
<li> <span>Finally, 83% said that the new rules will create an opportunity for&nbsp;regulatory alignment between the US/EU/UK (vs. 45% previously)</span> </li>
</ul>
<p><span><strong>Mike Carrodus, CEO of Substantive Research said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;87% of respondents are now saying that within two years, either the majority or half of budgets in Europe will be client-funded, which is an enormous shift. Asset managers increasingly perceive that the benefits to their investment process and cost structures now far outweigh any previous barriers to change. While concerns remain regarding the fair treatment of clients (<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://74n5c4m7.r.eu-west-1.awstrack.me/L0/https:%2F%2Fwww.fca.org.uk%2Ffirms%2Ffair-treatment-customers/1/01020197f8475eb3-7e83c6fe-2d28-461b-ac5f-e385dbda18eb-000000/VVVpD_78XkaCDFSx3kAUMfRtBy0=434" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><span>TCF</span></a>, as defined by the FCA), higher comfort levels from global firms with experience of CSA models in other regions, are feeding through to the domestic players.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>He added:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The removal of requirements around fund-level research budgeting has been transformational to sentiment on the buy side. Coupled with renewed determination from global firms to benefit from a single global research process, it is now clear that CSA-funded research will be &lsquo;the new norm&rsquo; by the end of 2026.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) has announced updated listing requirements for underlying crypto assets, expanding the eligible currencies for Exchange Traded Products (ETPs) with crypto assets as underlying assets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We continue to see a growing demand to invest in ETPs with crypto assets as underlying assets and in our efforts to modernize our markets we are happy to now be able to enable issuers to issue more currencies through the new guidelines,&rdquo; says Helena Wedin, Head of ETF and ETP, Nasdaq European Markets.</p>
<p>ETPs with crypto assets as underlying assets must comply with the relevant Nasdaq Main Market Exchange Trades Notes Rulebook as well as the Nasdaq Nordic Crypto Guidelines. The guidelines complement the rulebooks and outline specific requirements that must be met to admit an ETP with crypto assets as underlying assets. One of the requirements has been that the underlying crypto asset must be included in the Nasdaq Crypto Index. This has now been revised to also include requirements on, among other, pricing, liquidity and trading availability of the underlying crypto asset, &ndash; opening for more crypto assets to be included.</p>
<p>The revised guidelines are based on the existing requirements of the Nasdaq Crypto Index methodology and market practice.</p>

<title>SEC Charges Georgia-Based First Liberty Building &amp; Loan And Its Owner For Operating A $140 Million Ponzi Scheme</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced that it filed charges seeking an asset freeze and other emergency relief against Newnan, Georgia-based First Liberty Building &amp; Loan, LLC and its founder and owner Edwin Brant Frost IV in connection with a Ponzi scheme that defrauded approximately 300 investors of at least $140 million.</p>
<p>According to the SEC&rsquo;s complaint, from approximately 2014 through June 2025, First Liberty and Frost offered and sold to retail investors promissory notes and loan participation agreements that offered returns of up to 18% by representing that investor funds would be used to make short-term bridge loans to businesses at relatively high interest rates. The defendants allegedly told investors that very few of these loans had defaulted and that they would be repaid by borrowers via Small Business Administration or other commercial loans. The complaint also alleges that, while some investor funds were used to make bridge loans, those loans did not perform as represented, and most loans ultimately defaulted and ceased making interest payments. Since at least 2021, First Liberty operated as a Ponzi scheme by using new investor funds to make principal and interest payments to existing investors, according to the complaint.&nbsp;The complaint further alleges that Frost misappropriated investor funds for personal use, including by using investor funds to make over $2.4 million in credit card payments, paying more than $335,000 to a rare coin dealer, and spending $230,000 on family vacations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The promise of a high rate of return on an investment is a red flag that should make all potential investors think twice or maybe even three times before investing their money,&rdquo; said Justin C. Jeffries, Associate Director of Enforcement for the SEC&rsquo;s Atlanta Regional Office. &ldquo;Unfortunately, we&rsquo;ve seen this movie before - bad actors luring investors with promises of seemingly over-generous returns &ndash; and it does not end well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The SEC&rsquo;s complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, charges First Liberty and Frost with violating the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and names five entities that Frost controlled as relief defendants. The SEC seeks emergency relief, including an order freezing assets, appointing a receiver over the entities, and granting an accounting and expedited discovery. The SEC also seeks permanent injunctions and civil penalties against the defendants, a conduct-based injunction against Frost, and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains with prejudgment interest against the defendants and relief defendants.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying the allegations in the complaint, the defendants and relief defendants consented to the SEC&rsquo;s requested emergency and permanent relief, with monetary remedies to be determined by the court at a later date.</p>
<p>The SEC's investigation was conducted by Justin Delfino and Tiffany Kunkle and supervised by Peter Diskin and Mr. Jeffries. The litigation is being led by Kristin Murnahan and Graham Loomis<span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-8">
<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Thursday requested comment on a targeted proposal to revise its supervisory rating framework for large bank holding companies to address the "well managed" status of these firms. The revisions would better align the supervisory rating framework with and more accurately reflect the strength of bank holding companies and the banking system as a whole. The proposal would also better align the framework with the supervisory rating systems used for other banking organizations.</p>
<p>The Board's large bank supervisory rating framework, issued in 2018, evaluates whether these banks have sufficient financial and operational strength and resilience to maintain safe-and-sound operations and comply with laws and regulations through a range of conditions. The framework includes three components: capital, liquidity, and governance and controls. Each component has four potential ratings: broadly meets expectations, conditionally meets expectations, deficient-1, or deficient-2.</p>
<p>The proposal would amend the framework by considering a bank with no more than one "deficient-1" rating to be "well managed." Firms that do not meet this standard would be deemed not well managed and would face limitations on certain activities. Consistent with the current framework, a bank with a deficient-2 rating for any component would continue to be considered not well managed.</p>
<p>The Board is also proposing to make similar changes to its supervisory rating framework for insurers regulated by the Board.</p>
<p>The Board will evaluate additional comprehensive changes, including options to consider adding composite ratings to both frameworks, as well as changes to other supervisory rating systems.</p>
<p>Comments on today's proposal are due 30 days after publication in the&nbsp;<em>Federal Register</em>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Thank you, Lorie. Let me start by expressing my deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of those harmed by the flooding in the Hill Country. I cannot imagine the pain and anguish they are feeling. My prayers go out to all those affected.</p>
<p>Turning to my remarks for today, thank you also for the opportunity to speak to you about the Fed's balance sheet, one of the more complex, and, I believe, misunderstood aspects of the Federal Reserve's role as a central bank.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn1" title="footnote 1"><span>1</span></a><a name="f1"></a>&nbsp;To level set the conversation, let me start with some simple facts. In August of 2007 our balance sheet was around $870 billion, equal to approximately 6 percent of nominal gross domestic product (GDP). Today it is around $6.7&nbsp;<em>trillion</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>t</em>, which is about 22 percent of GDP. This is down significantly from its maximum size of nearly $9 trillion in early 2022 but still quite large. Since nominal GDP has essentially doubled since 2007, if our balance sheet had grown at the same rate, it would be around $1.7 trillion today&mdash;not $6.7 trillion.</p>
<p>An obvious question is why our balance sheet is so much larger than economic growth would have predicted. As an aside, let me point out that there is no consensus among economists about how large a central bank balance sheet should be, but it is logical to ask: if monetary policy worked when the balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, why is it, and perhaps needs to be, proportionally so much larger now?</p>
<p>A major reason is that the Federal Reserve embarked on two major balance sheet policy initiatives over the past twenty years to respond to urgent problems in the economy. First, we engaged in quantitative easing, or QE, to provide support to the economy after the advent of the Global Financial Crisis and then again with the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we consciously changed our implementation framework for providing liquidity to the banking system by moving from a scarce-reserves system to an ample-reserves system. This change was necessary because there were shortcomings with the scarce-reserves approach&mdash;short-term rates were harder to control and required daily interventions in the markets by the Fed, and these problems were made worse when rates were at or near zero. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) explicitly stated its commitment to ample reserves in 2019, when we were gradually shrinking our balance sheet, concluding that this approach would be used over the longer-run, and it soon proved very useful when the pandemic again brought rates to zero.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn2" title="footnote 2"><span>2</span></a><a name="f2"></a></p>
<p>Although these are two fundamentally different reasons for changing the size of our balance sheet, we did them more or less at the same time. This has caused confusion, with some people thinking that the Fed is choosing to keep the balance sheet larger than it needs to be. This confusion is amplified by the fact that there are external forces that have boosted the size of our balance sheet that are not under the control of the Federal Reserve. My goal today in this speech is to disentangle each of these forces and try to demystify the role of our balance sheet in conducting monetary policy. I also want to clarify issues that are currently being discussed in the public domain. I agree that the balance sheet needs to shrink but, as I will show, not by as much as some believe it should. I will also explain why the composition of the balance sheet matters as much as its size and how changes are needed there as well.</p>
<p>I know from teaching this topic over the years to my undergraduate students that unless you are an accountant or a banker, you would probably rather go to the dentist than listen to a speech about the Fed's balance sheet. I hope to explain it clearly enough that you can leave here and engage in the public debate with a better understanding of the issues. To do so, the approach I want to take is the following. Suppose the Fed had never used quantitative easing and simply decided to move to an ample-reserves system from a scarce-reserves system. How would the liability and asset sides of our balance sheet change in response to this one policy decision? After addressing this question, I will then discuss how QE affects our balance sheet and also some difficult tradeoffs that arise when engaging in QE.</p>
<p><span>The Big Three Liabilities</span><br />For any balance sheet, we start with the asset and liability entries. Assets are things that are owned, and liabilities are things that are owed to others at a given point in time. I will start by listing the big three liabilities on the Fed's balance sheet and the characteristics of those liabilities. There are other types of liabilities (and capital) that must be accounted for, but they are too small to matter for the policy matters I want to discuss, so I will ignore them. After discussing these "big three" liabilities, we can consider what assets should be held to match those liabilities.</p>
<p>The first big liability of the Federal Reserve is currency outstanding. The Fed supplies U.S. dollars elastically to the public, based on demand, distributing dollars through banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn3" title="footnote 3"><span>3</span></a><a name="f3"></a>&nbsp;That demand, which is not controlled by the Fed, is basically determined by how fast the economy&mdash;and thus the need for cash&mdash;is growing. At the end of 2024, the amount of dollars in circulation was $2.3 trillion. That is up considerably from around $800 billion in 2007 after which the overall balance sheet began growing sharply. Even in terms of GDP, currency has increased, from 5.5 percent of GDP in 2007 to almost 8 percent today. So, an important point that many do not realize is that the Fed's balance sheet has expanded, especially in nominal terms, from increased demand for U.S. currency.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn4" title="footnote 4"><span>4</span></a><a name="f4"></a></p>
<p>What are the characteristics of currency as a liability? First, it is non-interest bearing. Second, it never "matures" as other debt obligations do. Let's just say that currency is different from other liabilities&mdash;it pays no interest, and you never get back your initial payment for acquiring it. If you come to the Fed and ask us to redeem a dollar bill, we will simply give you another dollar bill.</p>
<p>The second big liability is the Treasury General Account, or TGA. The Federal Reserve is the fiscal agent of the U.S. Treasury, which means that we are the bank for the U.S. government and the TGA is the Treasury's checking account. What are the characteristics of the TGA? First, it is a short-term liability that moves up and down as cash flows in and out of the account as the Treasury receives tax and other payments and pays its bills. Second, we do not pay interest to the Treasury on its account balances. Finally, given the asynchronous timing of payments and receipts, the TGA can vary significantly, especially when the debt ceiling is binding. During 2024, it generally fluctuated between about $650 billion and $950 billion, briefly peaking at around $960 billion during the April tax season. Due to this year's debt ceiling constraint, the TGA fell from its 2024 average of $780 billion to about $325 billion recently, and with the debt ceiling just increased, there will be a quick rebuild in the coming weeks. So, it is not unusual for the TGA to fluctuate by several hundred billion dollars. This situation is very different than the one in 2007 when the TGA was deliberately held steady at $5 billion each day. This change reflects both how much federal spending has grown in that time and also a shift in accounting in 2015 to holding an estimated week's worth of federal payments in the TGA&mdash;a decision made by the Treasury to better manage its cash flow.</p>
<p>An important point that applies to both currency and the TGA is that the Federal Reserve does not have control over the size of these liabilities and hasn't been responsible for their sharp increases. Together, they represent about $3 trillion of our $6.7 trillion balance sheet, or roughly 10 percent of nominal gross domestic product. So, the size of the Fed's balance sheet, which is now about 22 percent of nominal GDP, is nearly half accounted for by these two liabilities that are not under the Fed's control. Those who argue that the Fed could go back to 2007, when its total balance sheet was 6 percent of GDP, fail to recognize that these two factors make it impossible.</p>
<p>The third big liability on the Fed's balance sheet is reserves, which are the funds that depository institutions hold in accounts at the Fed. In effect, these are the checking account balances of the banking system that are held at the Federal Reserve. What is the characteristic of reserves held by banks? First, much like the TGA, they are short term in nature and very liquid&mdash;in effect like digital cash. They are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system and used to conduct payments between banks. The reserve balances that an individual bank holds can increase or decrease, depending on the flow of payments between banks. Much like the TGA, an individual bank's reserve holdings can be volatile. But these payments do not change the total amount of reserves in the banking system&mdash;they simply transfer them from one bank to another. So, while reserve balances of individual banks can move around, total reserves are more stable, and the total amount of reserves in the system is directly controlled by the Federal Reserve. Second, in October 2008, Congress authorized the Federal Reserve to pay interest on these liabilities. Besides ending the implicit tax on banks for holding reserves, it was a step aimed at helping the Fed conduct monetary policy effectively, which it does, but it is sometimes inaccurately criticized as a giveaway to banks. I will address this point a little later. But I mention it here because the amount of reserves in the system affects the total payment flow the Fed must make to banks at the current interest rate on reserves.</p>
<p><span>Assets Backing These Liabilities</span><br />By the definition of a balance sheet, these liabilities must be matched by assets held by the Federal Reserve. Let's consider matching assets to our currency liability. As I said earlier, currency pays no interest and never matures. So, we can hold assets of any maturity length to offset our liability for currency. Since currency pays no interest, any interest earned off these assets is pure profit. Given that longer-maturity assets generally pay higher interest rates and are less volatile, it seems reasonable to hold longer maturity assets against our currency liability.</p>
<p>Now consider the TGA liability. We also pay no interest on the TGA. But, unlike currency, a problem with the TGA is that it can vary substantially, which makes total reserves in the system more volatile. This link to reserves is because when tax payments are made to the Treasury, we debit the payer's bank reserves and credit the Treasury's TGA account. When the Treasury makes a payment, we debit the TGA and credit the recipient bank's reserve account. Thus, volatile movements in the TGA affect the Fed's reserve management policy. There are two ways to deal with this situation: hold a buffer of reserves to ensure movements in the TGA do not affect market liquidity or hold short-maturity assets that we can expand or contract to sterilize movements in the TGA such that total reserves in the banking system are unchanged.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn5" title="footnote 5"><span>5</span></a><a name="f5"></a>&nbsp;The first strategy suggests the buffer stock of assets could take the form of somewhat longer maturity, while the second strategy could require holding short-term assets that can easily be bought and sold with little interest rate risk.</p>
<p>That brings us to reserves. As I mentioned, reserves are a short-maturity liability which pay interest, which suggests that the Fed should consider holding short maturity assets against this liability. Treasury bills and short-maturity Treasury notes are the safest and most liquid assets, so it would make sense to hold them against reserves. If the interest rate earned on our short maturity Treasury assets is very close to the interest we pay on reserves, then our interest earnings from the Treasury are simply passed through to the banks. In this sense, our balance sheet is just another way to transfer interest payments on Treasury securities from the Treasury to the banks.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn6" title="footnote 6"><span>6</span></a><a name="f6"></a></p>
<p>Because of the minimal spread between these two short-term interest rates, banks are largely indifferent to either holding reserves or the short-term Treasury securities we hold&mdash;both are highly liquid and pay roughly the same rate of return. But layer on top of this the fact that reserves are a bit more liquid than Treasury securities because banks don't have to buy or sell the Treasury securities to get reserves, and banks are willing to hold a lot of reserves. Since the Fed supplies these reserves, one might ask what it costs taxpayers to supply a large amount of reserves. From the Treasury's point of view, its interest expense is the same regardless of who holds the short-term Treasury securities. So, the Fed can provide all the liquidity that banks need at zero marginal cost, which makes me wonder why some want to make reserves scarce. I often use the following analogy to drive this point home: If governments could provide clean, safe drinking water for citizens at zero cost, why would they make it scarce?</p>
<p>Now, one could ask why pay interest on reserves at all? Why not keep the interest income generated on the assets we hold to back reserves and remit it back to the Treasury? This seems like a no brainer! But there are a few reasons that interest on reserves makes sense, including the following.</p>
<p>First, paying interest on reserves that is commensurate to the rate paid on short-term Treasury securities makes reserves attractive to banks, and holding reserves improves the functioning of the financial system by giving banks more liquidity and greater scope to settle payments in an orderly way. In contrast, if reserves bear no interest, then commercial banks will have strong incentives to avoid holding a lot of reserves, and instead hold short-term, interest-bearing assets like Treasury bills. If banks managed their liquidity only by buying and selling Treasury securities, several banks selling Treasury securities at the same time could flood the market and put undesirable upward pressure on interest rates across the economy. An ample-reserves regime where we pay interest on reserves ensures that there are enough reserves in the banking system to avoid this kind of sell off in Treasury securities, helping to stabilize the financial system without any harm to banks or their customers.</p>
<p>The second part of the case for interest on reserves is that it isn't costing taxpayers any money. As I noted earlier, whether the Fed or banks hold the Treasury securities, the Treasury is paying interest on its debt. And, if the Fed is holding the reserves, then the interest payment from the Treasury to the Fed on the Treasury bills is matched with an interest payment from the Fed to banks on their reserves. So, paying interest on reserves is not creating any additional expense to the Treasury.</p>
<p>But what is the appropriate level of ample reserves the Fed is trying to get to? There is no clear answer to this question and that is what we are trying to discern. We want to provide the amount of liquidity necessary, but we don't want to provide excessive liquidity that banks do not want or need.</p>
<p>One reason for increased demand for reserves is that since the Global Financial Crisis changes in banking regulations led to a large shift in demand for high-quality liquid assets. For example, bank liquidity regulations, such as the liquidity coverage ratio, encouraged banks to hold high quality liquid assets. As these regulations came into play, banks' demand for high-quality liquid assets, including reserves, increased tremendously relative to 2007.</p>
<p>I think of ample reserves as the threshold below which banks would need to scramble to find safe, liquid funding, something that would drive up the federal funds rate and money market interest rates across the economy. We have some experience with testing the level of ample reserves during an episode of stress in the financial system that occurred in 2019. At the start of that year, reserves stood at about 8 percent of nominal GDP, and we were continuing to reduce our balance sheet with no apparent stress among banks or otherwise in the financial system. In September 2019, reserves fell below 7 percent of nominal GDP, and stresses appeared in the financial system, requiring the Fed to step in and take action to add reserves. So, I start from the view that problems emerged when reserves fell below 8 percent of GDP. One might argue that banks are now larger relative to GDP, so they may desire a bit more reserves. Furthermore, there is also a genuine concern that it is not only the total amount of reserves that matters but also the distribution of reserves across the banking system. So, I would add a buffer to the 8 percent of GDP that I cited earlier and assume 9 percent is the threshold below which reserves would not be ample. That would mean, as of today, that $2.7 trillion of reserves is roughly ample&mdash;it could be more or less in practice, but let me use it as a benchmark.</p>
<p>So, putting the pieces of this hypothetical minimum balance sheet together, we have an estimated $2.7 trillion in reserve balances, $2.3 trillion in currency, and an average of $780 billion in TGA liabilities. This combined means the Fed should be operating with a balance sheet that is roughly $5.8 trillion dollars or 19 percent of GDP. Close to half of this proportional increase from 2007, as I noted, comes from currency and TGA growth outside the Fed's control, and the rest from a transition to an ample reserves regime that has been a necessary, efficient and more effective way of managing monetary policy.</p>
<p>In summary, if we had simply adopted an ample reserves system and backed these liabilities as I suggested without engaging in quantitative easing, there are three key takeaways: (1) we would be earning a net profit off of the assets backing currency and the TGA, (2) the assets backing ample reserves would simply be a way to transfer interest payments to the banks, and (3) we would hold short to medium term assets that could be bought or sold to neutralize large movements in the TGA to keep total reserves stable. With this balance sheet, the Federal Reserve would never run losses, the banks would have ample liquidity for market functioning, and the Fed would not face serious interest rate risk on its asset holdings.</p>
<p><span>Today's Balance Sheet and Where We Are Heading</span><br />At this point there are going to be people somewhere shaking their fists and yelling that what I have said is simply false because the Federal Reserve is currently losing money on its balance sheet. Our interest expense on reserves is now exceeding our interest income on our asset holdings. This is all true. But this outcome is because of engaging in QE for many years since 2007, not because we are running an ample reserves system. Remember, what I have described so far is what an optimally designed balance sheet would look like if we had never engaged in QE and simply moved to an ample-reserves system.</p>
<p>Let me now do the following. Assume we have a balance sheet that corresponds to an ample-reserves system, but now the Fed engages in QE as a means of conducting monetary policy to support the economy.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve engaged in QE programs when the policy rate was driven down to zero because of severe shocks to the economy after the Global Financial Crisis and then because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Once the policy rate is at zero, the Federal Reserve is constrained in its ability to use its traditional tools to provide further support for the economy. The idea of QE is to buy longer-duration securities as opposed to short-duration assets. By increasing the demand for long-dated securities, the Fed drives up the price and drives down the yield on those securities. By lowering longer-term yields the Fed is able to loosen financing conditions to stimulate aggregate demand. The Fed typically buys longer-dated Treasury securities during QE, but it also bought agency mortgage-backed securities that have the implicit backing of the U.S. Treasury and are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored enterprises.</p>
<p>QE affects our balance sheet in material ways that differ from what happens if one is simply constructing the balance sheet to support ample reserves, currency, and the TGA. First, it increases the duration of our balance sheet beyond what we would hold just for currency. Longer-duration assets are more prone to interest rate risk, and the lower the interest rates on those assets, the lower interest income the Fed will receive far into the future. If interest rates rise suddenly or over time as the economy recovers, those assets lose value (in substantial amounts), which lowers the unrealized value of our portfolio. Second, we use short-term reserves to buy the longer duration assets which leads to a maturity mismatch between our assets and our liabilities. So, the additional reserves that are injected from QE may not be costless when short-term rates rise, as they did in 2022, meaning that interest paid on those additional reserves will exceed what is earned on the long-term assets that were purchased with them.</p>
<p>This effect highlights the fact that engaging in QE involves a tradeoff for the Federal Reserve&mdash;trying to support the economy in serious economic downturns at the zero lower bound while creating a maturity mismatch between our assets and liabilities that brings interest rate risk onto our balance sheet. This tradeoff does not happen if we simply structure our balance sheet to support an ample-reserves system. The decision to engage in QE requires the Federal Reserve to weigh the benefits and costs from this action. Those benefits and costs are often difficult to quantify at the time QE is undertaken. It is only with hindsight that we can fully assess them, which is one of the challenges of making policy in real time.</p>
<p>Where do we stand today? The Federal Reserve is operating with an abundant, or more than ample, level of reserves, and our securities holdings are tilted toward longer-dated maturities. We are shrinking the balance sheet to get back to a size consistent with an ample reserves system. As of last month, banks had nearly $3.4 trillion of reserves with the Fed, accounting for about 11 percent of nominal GDP.<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm#fn7" title="footnote 7"><span>7</span></a><a name="f7"></a>&nbsp;Given my rough estimate of the level of reserves needed to be ample, I believe we can likely continue to let a share of maturing and prepaying securities roll off our balance sheet for some time, reducing reserve balances. Of course, we will continue to carefully monitor financial markets as we go.</p>
<p>For me, the bigger problem with our balance sheet is that the maturity structure of our assets to support an ample-reserves system is not well matched. We have far too many long-term assets on our balance sheet relative to my arguments for how to structure the balance sheet. I argued that long-term assets should only be held against currency liabilities, which are $2.3 trillion. But we hold about $2.3 trillion in agency mortgage-backed securities alone! So the duration of our asset portfolio is far too long for the liabilities we need to hold for an ample-reserves system.</p>
<p>If the Fed moved forward with a maturity-matching strategy as I suggest, it would hold about half of its Treasury securities in shorter-dated bills. There have been some advocates who support moving toward the Federal Reserve having a Treasury securities portfolio whose composition mimics the breakdown, or "universe," of total Treasury securities outstanding. This would mean having about 20 percent of our current balance sheet in bills. The argument for this maturity structure is that with this approach, the Fed's holdings would not be putting pressure on any one segment of the yield curve. This is a valid argument, but it would put more duration on our balance sheet and expose the Fed to potential income losses, as we have witnessed the past few years. Maybe that is a tradeoff we should make to avoid distorting our demand for Treasury securities relative to the market's demand. In the end, I support continuing the conversation about what the ultimate composition should be. My objective today was to try to clarify what an ample-reserves balance sheet should look like as a starting point for this conversation.</p>
<p>In the years ahead, moving our portfolio toward shorter-duration securities will be a slow process unless we were to take the dramatic step of selling existing securities to replace them with Treasury bills. When reserves hit their desired ample level and we need to increase securities holdings in line with growth in autonomous factors, like currency and the TGA, we can actively accumulate bills, if we do not take other actions sooner.</p>
<p>I hope that taking a deep dive into a few line items on the Fed's balance sheet has helped to see some issues that lie ahead. Though the FOMC has not finalized its desired efficient and effective size and composition of the balance sheet, it seems apparent that today's portfolio should be adjusted. And there are obvious steps to take. We are reducing the size of the balance sheet slowly and need to consider shifting it toward more bills. As we do so, we should do it gradually and predictably, so the markets and public are fully aware of our actions.</p>

<p><a name="fn1"></a>1. The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn2"></a>2. In January 2019 the FOMC released the Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization, which is available on the Board's website at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm">https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130c.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn3"></a>3. The Federal Reserve supplies currency on demand to ensure that commercial bank money trades one for one with currency. This creates certainty that a customer's demand to transform one unit of commercial bank money into a unit of currency will be met.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn4"></a>4. Judson (2024) estimates that a significant share of demand for U.S. currency comes from abroad, especially in the $100 denomination; see Ruth Judson (2024),&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.17016/IFDP.2024.1387">"Demand for U.S Banknotes at Home and Abroad: A Post-Covid Update,"</a>&nbsp;International Finance Discussion Papers 1387 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, March).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn5"></a>5. For a discussion of the short-maturity assets approach, please see Annette Vissing-Jorgenson (forthcoming), "Fluctuations in the Treasury General Account and the Fed's Balance Sheet," FEDS Notes (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn6"></a>6. For accounting purposes, our net interest income on these assets backing reserve balances would be near zero.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a name="fn7"></a>7. As I noted, there will be a replenishing of the TGA in coming weeks. This action will reduce reserves commensurately.&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) has issued a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/media/13506/download?inline" target="_self" title="CIRO White Paper: Enhancing Timely and Efficient Account Transfers in Canada">white paper</a>&nbsp;that offers regulatory and technological solutions to improve account transfers, a major source of frustration for investors.</p>
<p>The financial system in Canada faces significant inefficiencies in account transfers, largely due to outdated processes, inconsistent standards, and fragmented communication. Delays in account transfers can disrupt financial planning and lead to adverse financial consequences for investors, including missed investment opportunities. Account transfers are also a persistent operational frustration for financial institutions as well. Addressing these delays is critical for enhancing the Canadian capital markets system and improving investor outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Account transfers are consistently a top complaint that CIRO hears from investors and Member firms alike,&rdquo; said Alexandra Williams, Senior Vice-President, Strategy, Innovation, and Stakeholder Protection at CIRO. &ldquo;Modernizing the account transfer system is an important way by which CIRO can improve investor outcomes and reduce frustration, but also enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the industry &ndash; both key commitments of our strategic plan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Modernizing account transfers will require a multi-faceted approach that includes automation of systems, standardization of transfer procedures, and harmonization of regulations. CIRO&rsquo;s work to support this effort takes a two-phased approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: Defining the Problem &amp; Laying the Groundwork for Change</li>
<li>Phase 2: Implementing Solutions &amp; Driving Industry-Wide Adoption</li>
</ul>
<p>The Phase 1 white paper, released today, examines the root causes of account transfer issues and presents both immediate and long-term solutions, including rule amendments and recommendations to enhance firm transfer operations.</p>
<p>Also released today are proposed rule amendments which, if adopted, will require all CIRO Dealer Members to use automated systems for eligible transfers and clarify that electronic communications must be used where available. They also stipulate the timeline for the receiving dealer to inform the client of transfer impediments and set a standard settlement period of 10 clearing days for account transfers (including for transfers with impediments).</p>
<p>In addition, the Phase 1 white paper also offers a vision for an industry-wide technology solution, designed through a collaborative effort by institutions across the financial and investment industry, that would digitize the account transfer process and allow for real-time processing and standardized data formats. This new system promises to be open, interoperable, and transparent and would ensure a seamless data exchange across Canada&rsquo;s financial system.</p>
<p>CIRO is inviting:</p>
<ul>
<li>comments on its proposed rule amendments</li>
<li>proposals from interested firms seeking to develop the technology solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 2 of the white paper, which is expected in 2026, will provide updates on the progress, implementation strategies, and more wide-spread adoption of the regulatory standards and technology tool across the financial system.</p>
<p>The Phase 1 white paper and the proposed rule amendments are now available on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ciro.ca/newsroom/publications/modernization-requirements-account-transfers-and-bulk-account-movements-idpc-rule-4800-and-mfd-rule" target="_self" title="Modernization of requirements for account transfers and bulk account movements (IDPC Rule 4800 and MFD Rule 2.12)">CIRO&rsquo;s website</a>.</p>

<title>Canadian Securities Administrators Announces Final Amendments To Multilateral Instrument 13-102 System Fees</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) today published in final form&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/-/media/ASC-Documents-part-1/Regulatory-Instruments/2025/07/6237017-v1-CSA-Notice-Amendments-to-MI-13-102.pdf">amendments to Multilateral Instrument 13-102&nbsp;<em>System Fees</em>&nbsp;(MI 13-102)</a>.<br /><br />The CSA is increasing system fees for SEDAR+ and the National Registration Database (NRD) over a five-year period starting on November 28, 2025. These system fee increases are necessary to ensure sufficient funding to operate the CSA&rsquo;s national systems over those five years. Under the amendments the total dollar amount of system fees collected by the CSA will increase and no new system fees will be introduced. To maintain a fair and transparent cost recovery approach, the CSA uses a flat per-filing system fee model, where fees increase proportionally based on system use.</p>
<p>The CSA published&nbsp;<a href="https://www.asc.ca/en/News-and-Publications/News-Releases/2024/11/Nov-21-CSA-propose-amendments-to-Multilateral-Instrument-13-102-System-Fees">proposed amendments on November 21, 2024</a>, and outlined changes that would better align system fee revenues with projected national systems operating costs. After carefully considering the comments received, the CSA has not made any substantive revisions to the materials that were published for comment. However, since amendments to introduce an expedited shelf prospectus regime for well-known seasoned issuers (WKSIs) are scheduled to come into force at the same time as the MI 13-102 amendments, the WKSI-related system fees have been added to the MI 13-102 amendments. Provided all required approvals are obtained, the amendments will come into force on November 28, 2025, in all participating CSA jurisdictions.<br /><br />The CSA, the council of the securities regulators of Canada&rsquo;s provinces and territories, coordinates and harmonizes regulation for the Canadian capital markets.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) announces that Mr. Usman Asif has been charged with fraud, contrary to s. 126.1(1)(b) of the&nbsp;<em>Securities Act</em>, as well as breaching a cease trade order.</p>
<p>The charges announced relate to Lendle Corporation where Mr. Asif was a director.</p>
<p>The OSC alleges that Mr. Asif, through his company, Lendle Corporation, issued a security in the form of a promissory note to All Ships Investors Incorporated (&ldquo;All Ships&rdquo;) while subject to a cease trade order. The OSC alleges that the transaction was part of a fraudulent scheme to issue and securitize consumer loans through an online lending platform. It is further alleged that Mr. Asif repeatedly deceived All Ships before and after accepting a $315,000 investment from them, which he spent primarily on personal expenses, including a Lamborghini.</p>
<p>On November 1, 2023, the&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/en/proceedings/decisions-in-brief/decision-brief-mughal-asset-management-corporation-enforcement-proceeding-merits-november-1-2023" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">OSC Tribunal found</a> that Mr. Asif and his companies, Lendle Corporation and Mughal Asset Management Corporation, committed fraud. The Capital Markets Tribunal also determined that Asif lied to OSC staff during the investigation, shared confidential OSC information, and interfered with the OSC&rsquo;s investigation.</p>
<p>Mr. Asif was&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/en/proceedings/decisions-in-brief/decision-brief-mughal-asset-management-corporation-enforcement-proceeding-sanctions-and-costs-june-3" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">permanently banned from trading<span>&nbsp;</span></a><span>in June 2024. Prior to that he was bound by a&nbsp;</span><a class="ext" href="https://www.capitalmarketstribunal.ca/en/proceedings/mughal-asset-management-corporation-re/notice-hearing-matter-mughal-asset-management-corporation-usman-asif" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank" title="(opens in a new window)">temporary cease trade order<span>&nbsp;</span></a> issued in December 2021.</p>
<p>This case was investigated by the OSC&rsquo;s Criminal Investigations &amp; Prosecutions team, which is part of the Enforcement Division of the OSC. They investigate securities-related frauds, market manipulation, and related misconduct, including the investigation of repeat offenders and those who breach Capital Markets Tribunal or court orders and bans. Their primary objective is to protect investors and further enhance confidence in the Canadian capital markets through effective enforcement. To do this, they often partner and collaborate with other law enforcement agencies and police forces.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk. Investors are urged to check the registration of any persons or company offering an investment opportunity and to review the OSC investor materials available at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.osc.ca/">http://www.osc.ca</a>.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li> 25 companies and 90 investors and financing experts participated in the first European funding days dedicated to the aerospace and defence sector </li>
<li> 190 meetings were organised between companies, investors and financing experts </li>
<li> New European Defence Bond Label, granting fast-track admission to qualifying bonds </li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today announced the successful deployment of its tailored solutions to enhance the financing of European aerospace and defence companies, reinforcing Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy. On 7 and 8 July 2025,&nbsp;Euronext successfully organised the first European aerospace and defence funding days. To complement the launch of its European defence bonds segment in May 2025, Euronext also created a European Defence Bond Label, enabling fast-track admission process for the issuance of European defence bonds on Euronext. Both initiatives are designed to accelerate access to capital and to finance the growing needs of European aerospace and defence companies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>St&eacute;phane Boujnah, CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>"European aerospace and defence companies are facing urgent needs to invest in their innovation and production capacities to guarantee Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy for the next decade. As a capital market infrastructure, our role is to connect these financing needs with investment capabilities arising from the growing investor appetite in European markets. By creating tailored financing solutions and by bringing together entrepreneurs, investors and financial experts, Euronext effectively accelerates the financing of the aerospace and defence sector.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>First European aerospace and defence funding days</span></p>
<p>Euronext provides&nbsp;tailored financing solutions for&nbsp;European companies operating in strategic sectors and gives them unprecedented tools to meet their financing needs through easier access to capital. In return, Euronext also gives asset managers, institutional investors and retail investors more investment opportunities in high-growth segments within the aerospace and defence industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On 7 and 8 July 2025, Euronext successfully organised the first European aerospace and defence funding days. This initiative aims to accelerate access to capital for companies operating across the aerospace and defence industry,&nbsp;spanning diverse sectors such as aeronautics, cybersecurity,&nbsp;drones, land defence and&nbsp;new&nbsp;space. The event was designed to accelerate connections and facilitate direct engagement with long-term investors and financial experts. Throughout the funding days, companies deepened their understanding of equity and debt capital market tools, from equity to debt financing, and gained valuable insights from specialised financial institutions.</p>
<p>This event brought together 25 aerospace and defence companies seeking financing with over 90 investors and financing experts from across Europe, including Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Switzerland and the UK. 190 meetings were organised between companies, investors and financing experts.</p>
<p><span>Philippe Bottu, CEO and Chairman of D.A.T.E.<span><sup>1</sup></span>, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Participating in Euronext&rsquo;s first European aerospace and defence funding days was a decisive opportunity to affirm D.A.T.E strategic role and accelerate access to the capital needed to support our industrial ambitions.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Ezequiel S&aacute;nchez, Executive President of PLD Space<span><sup>2</sup></span>, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;We are understanding the needs of the financial markets to better anticipate the best solution. Company-Market fit in technology is the outcome of a maturity process. We are doing our homework.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>New European Defence Bond Label</span></p>
<p>Euronext also introduces the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/list-products/bonds/european-defence-bonds">European Defence Bond Label</a>. This label is a voluntary, market-driven initiative for listed bonds aimed at directing private capital towards eligible Defence and Security projects in Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Developed in close consultation with investors, issuers and financial institutions, the European Defence Bond Label offers clear eligibility criteria based on the use of proceeds. It is set to be used for the issuance of European defence bonds on Euronext markets and will serve as the basis for granting the fast-track admission process&nbsp;<a href="https://www.euronext.com/en/about/media/euronext-press-releases/euronext-strengthens-its-support-for-european-strategic">announced earlier in May 2025</a>&nbsp;to qualifying bonds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>European defence bonds already benefit from enhanced visibility and accessibility on Euronext. As of June 2025, over &euro;7 billion has been raised through the listing of more than 15 bonds from five issuers across Euronext markets. In June 2025, the bond programme from Italian aerospace and defence company Leonardo has been approved by CONSOB to issue up to &euro;4 billion in listed bonds.</p>
<p><span>Notes:</span></p>
<p><span>1</span>&nbsp;Founded in 1979, D.A.T.E is a French company positioned in the aerospace and defence industry, offering solutions for defence radars, submarine sonars and satellite exchangers, but also in the research market, with solutions for particle accelerators, quantum computers and dark matter reactors, and in the plastic industry.</p>

<title>Basel Committee Shares Report On Interconnections Between Banks And Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/basel-committee-shares-report-on-interconnections-between-banks-and-non-bank-fin-2025710/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul>
<li>The report reflects the findings of an analysis conducted as part of the Committee's forward-looking work to identify and analyse risks and vulnerabilities to the banking system.</li>
<li>The report identifies the services banks and non-bank financial intermediaries (NBFIs) provide to each other and the trends shaping the relationship between them.</li>
<li>The Committee will continue to monitor and investigate the interconnections between banks and NBFIs with a particular focus on synthetic risk transfers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has today published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bis.org/bcbs/publ/d598.htm"><span class="firstword">horizon-scanning</span>&nbsp;report on the interconnections between banks and non-bank financial intermediaries</a>&nbsp;(NBFIs). The NBFI sector has grown rapidly in recent years and includes a broad range of entities including investment funds, insurance companies, pension funds and other types of financial intermediaries.</p>
<p>Banks and NBFIs are linked by a wide range of activities and services and the sectors are mutually dependent. Banks provide leverage, clearing, market-making and underwriting services to NBFIs, trade derivatives with NBFIs and, in some cases, own NBFIs. These activities expose banks to a wide variety of risks. NBFIs are also exposed to banks through short-term cash placements, investment in securities issued by banks and trading activities. The nature of their linkages is shaped by market conditions and by regulatory reforms over the last several years.</p>
<p>To explore the risks associated with banks' interconnections with NBFIs, the report builds on several case studies to discuss stylised scenarios that illustrate possible impacts of NBFI failure on banks and financial stability. The report also discusses the importance of granular, timely and high-frequency data in understanding and monitoring linkages between banks and NBFIs.</p>
<p>The Committee will continue to monitor and investigate the interconnections between banks and NBFIs with a particular focus on synthetic risk transfers (SRTs). The investigation will seek to better assess the benefits and risks posed by SRTs.</p>

<title>GLEIF Confirms TradeGo As Qualified vLEI Issuer, Ushering In A New Era Of Trusted Digital Trade - TradeGo Integrates vLEI Credentials Into Blockchain-Based Solutions To Advance Cross-Border Commodity Trading, Shipping, And Payments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gleif-confirms-tradego-as-qualified-vlei-issuer-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-truste-2025710/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/gleif-confirms-tradego-as-qualified-vlei-issuer-ushering-in-a-new-era-of-truste-2025710/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>
<div class="elementToProof">The Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF) today announces that TradeGo Pte. Ltd., a Singapore-based digital platform for commodity trade, has been approved as a Qualified vLEI Issuer (QVI) within the verifiable Legal Entity Identifier (vLEI) ecosystem. TradeGo is a Singapore-based digital platform for commodity trade jointly established by major industry players, financial institutions, shipping companies, and technology firms. This milestone strengthens efforts to build a transparent, efficient, and interoperable international trade environment by equipping TradeGo to issue cryptographically verifiable organizational identities.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Users of the TradeGo platform span industry players across bulk commodities, shipping, and finance. By embedding vLEI credentials across its blockchain-based solutions &ndash; which include electronic bills of lading (eBL), e-contracts, digital payments, and electronic bunkering &ndash; TradeGo aims to simplify cross-border commodity trading, shipping, and payments. This reduces fraud risk, lowers compliance costs, and supports alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks promoting trade digitalization &ndash; including Singapore&rsquo;s Electronic Transactions Act and the UK&rsquo;s Electronic Trade Documents Act.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">TradeGo&rsquo;s integration of vLEI credentials builds on its platform&rsquo;s digitalization capabilities to deliver significant operational benefits. Data from TradeGo&rsquo;s pilot and pre-qualification scenarios showed that its solutions can cut digital payment compliance costs by up to 90 percent, reduce manual operations by 80 percent, and increase trade document processing efficiency by over 60 percent. These initial outcomes illustrate the transformative potential of combining blockchain-based trade solutions with globally verifiable digital identities as TradeGo begins full-scale vLEI credential issuance.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Looking ahead, achieving QVI status forms part of TradeGo's broader ambition to create a trusted global digital ecosystem linking identity, business, and data &ndash; known as GIFTS (Global Inter-entity Financial and Trading Society).</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof">Alexandre Kech, CEO of GLEIF, said: &ldquo;TradeGo&rsquo;s approval as a QVI is a powerful endorsement of the role the vLEI can play in addressing the long-standing identity and compliance challenges that have constrained cross-border trade &ndash; creating significant fragmentation and inefficiencies. By integrating the vLEI as a globally standardized, cryptographically verifiable organizational identifier into blockchain-enabled solutions, TradeGo is overcoming these barriers and demonstrating what the future of trusted digital trade looks like.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Mr. Yu Yingjiao, CEO of TradeGo, commented: &ldquo;This milestone reinforces TradeGo&rsquo;s mission to build a seamless and trusted digital trade environment. By embedding vLEI credentials across our platform, we are creating a foundation for truly interoperable global trade, where one identity supports participation across ecosystems. We welcome partners to join us on this journey.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">Xu Jun, Vice Chair of the ICC Banking Commission Steering Committee, added: &ldquo;The ability to verify cross-border entities instantly is essential for reducing KYC costs and eliminating fraud risks in trade finance. Integrating the vLEI across TradeGo&rsquo;s ecosystem offers a credible, forward-looking solution for the industry.&rdquo;</div>
<div class="elementToProof"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="elementToProof">GLEIF encourages participants across the global trade and finance ecosystem to explore how the vLEI, combined with innovative platforms like TradeGo, can support more efficient, transparent, and secure global trade.</div>
<div class="elementToProof">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="elementToProof">For more information on the vLEI, please visit the GLEIF website&nbsp;<span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a class="safe---anchor---wc OWAAutoLink" href="https://www.gleif.org/en/vlei/introducing-the-verifiable-lei-vlei" id="OWA0eb6ce0c-976d-815e-2ce3-7cb13aedb20a" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></span></span>.</div>

<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA&rsquo;s annual report sets out how it has used data and technology to crack down on harm in financial services.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Over 1,600 websites suspected of promoting financial services without permission were suspended, removed or blocked in 2024 because of FCA action, as part of its fight against financial crime. The regulator also collaborated with big tech platforms, resulting in over 50 apps being removed from Google Play and the App Store. This has helped the regulator in its work to block fraud at source.</p>
<p>New technology also helped the FCA identify firms that did not meet its standards earlier and at scale. In 2024 the regulator intervened to ensure almost 20,000 non-compliant financial promotions were amended or withdrawn by authorised firms, compared to under 600 in 2021. It took action to protect social media users from illegal financial promotions by unauthorised &lsquo;finfluencers&rsquo;. The FCA also cancelled the authorisations of over 1,500 firms - 20% more than in 2023, and more than triple the number in 2021.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/annual-reports/annual-report-2024-25" title="Our Annual Report and Accounts 2024/25">FCA&rsquo;s annual report</a>&nbsp;sets out how it has delivered these and other important improvements for consumers, firms and markets in the final year of its 2022-2025 strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ashley Alder, Chair of the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Our annual report shows how we&rsquo;ve laid the strongest possible foundation from which to implement our new strategy. We&rsquo;ll build on this over the next five years to deepen trust and rebalance risk so we can support growth and improve lives.'</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, Chief Executive of the FCA, said:</p>
<p>'We've embraced data and technology to crack down on harm and ensure high standards.</p>
<p>'I'm proud of our achievements over the course of our last strategy: the biggest changes to listing rules in 30+ years, making it easier for companies to raise capital, ensuring good outcomes under the Consumer Duty, and cutting authorisation times for firms that meet standards.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re ambitious for the future, and committed to enabling a fair and thriving financial services market for the good of consumers and the economy.'</p>
<p>Over the past year, the FCA has:</p>
<h3>Reduced and prevented serious harm</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fined 2 banks a total of over &pound;45.5m for financial crime failures on sanction controls and screening, and monitoring of money laundering risks.</li>
<li>Issued 2,240 alerts about unauthorised firms and individuals.</li>
<li>Targeted unauthorised influencers, interviewing 20 under caution for illegally promoting financial products and issuing 38 alerts against finfluencer social media accounts.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Set and tested higher standards&nbsp;</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved outcomes for consumers through the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/consumer-duty" title="Consumer Duty">Consumer Duty</a>, where its work on GAP insurance has saved consumers &pound;70m.</li>

</ul>
<h3>Promoted competition and positive change &nbsp;</h3>

The new index will include companies listed on all U.S. exchanges including leaders at the NYSE, update its composition more dynamically including with quicker inclusion of IPOs, and include only highly liquid and investable constituents.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority To Modernise Rules To Unlock Investment</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA is planning to review its client categorisation rules to unlock more opportunities for wealthy investors and support capital markets, driving economic growth.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>The reform will build on 10 initiatives the FCA has already delivered since January to support growth, with around 50 to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Client categorisation rules protect retail clients investing in capital markets, without imposing undue restrictions on professional clients. Reviewing the rules will ensure that expectations remain proportionate when dealing with wealthy or very experienced investors. This will give confidence to firms and support investment in capital markets, boosting the competitiveness of financial services. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Nikhil Rathi, chief executive of the FCA, said: 'Modernising the client classification regime will provide greater clarity about the rules and protections applying to different customer groups, particularly for wholesale firms. We want to rebalance risk to support growth and competitiveness, which is at the heart of our strategy. We are delivering a large number of reforms to support a bolder risk appetite, making it easier for companies to raise capital and reimagining financial advice and guidance to boost investment.'<br /><br />The FCA&rsquo;s completed growth initiatives include:</p>
<ul>
<li>More flexible regulation: Set out steps to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-sets-out-steps-support-home-ownership" title="FCA sets out steps to support home ownership">improve access to mortgages</a>, reminding lenders of the flexibility of its interest rate stress testing rules to help more people onto the housing ladder.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-continues-mortgage-rule-review-boost-home-ownership-and-support-growth" title="FCA continues mortgage rule review to boost home ownership and support growth">More changes</a>&nbsp;are to come to improve access and flexibility for borrowers.</li>
<li>Unlocking investment: A pioneering new private stock market,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-rings-bell-new-type-private-stock-market-growth-boost" title="FCA rings bell on new type of private stock market in growth boost">PISCES</a>, making it easier and quicker to trade in private shares. This gives investors the opportunity to invest in high-growth private companies that are not usually available until they are publicly listed.</li>
<li>Accelerating innovation: A new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/news-stories/digital-securities-sandbox-opens-applications" title="Digital Securities Sandbox opens for applications">Digital Securities Sandbox</a>, launched in partnership with the Bank of England, giving firms the opportunity to explore new technologies.</li>
<li>Helping firms set up and grow: Extra support for firms seeking regulatory approval through the extension of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/firms/authorisation/pre-application-support-service" title="Pre-application support service (PASS)">pre-application support service</a>&nbsp;to all wholesale, payments and cryptoassets firms. This will encourage firms in these sectors to set up in the UK to fuel growth, exports and job creation, while maintaining standards. In the last year alone, the FCA has supported 80 firms via pre-application meetings.</li>
<li>Promoting the UK: Established a presence in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-establishes-presence-united-states-and-asia-pacific" title="FCA establishes presence in the United States and Asia-Pacific">US and Asia-Pacific</a>&nbsp;to help the export of UK financial services and attract more inward investment to our shores.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work is well underway delivering other growth initiatives, such as supporting capital markets by making changes to prospectus rules and getting rid of unnecessary data reporting to ease the regulatory burden for firms. The FCA is also simplifying and consolidating capital rules for investment firms, which would cut the volume of legal text by 70%.</p>
<p>These new initiatives build on landmark changes made to the listings regime last year, which has enabled 23 significant transactions to pass more easily, improving the efficiency of markets.</p>
<p>In the most recent&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.longfinance.net/programmes/financial-centre-futures/global-financial-centres-index/gfci-publications/the-global-financial-centres-index-37/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Global Financial Centres Index (opens in a new window)">Global Financial Centres Index<span class="sr-only">Link is external</span><span class="ext">&nbsp;</span></a>&nbsp;London has retained its position as the second highest rated financial centre and has narrowed the gap to New York. London also now ranks first worldwide in the banking sector compared to last year&rsquo;s third place.</p>
<p>The FCA will publish its Secondary International Competitiveness and Growth Objective (SICGO) report on Thursday 10 July, highlighting the progress made on its work to support growth.</p>
<h2>Background&nbsp;</h2>
<ol>
<li>Later today the FCA will publish its secondary objective report alongside its annual report and associated publications. Publication timing is subject to it being laid in Parliament.</li>
<li>The secondary objective report includes the FCA&rsquo;s list of growth commitments.</li>
<li>The FCA will be consulting on the elective professional client categorisation later this year.</li>
<li>On 15 January 2025, the FCA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/fca-letter-new-approach-support-growth.pdf" title="PM letter">wrote to the Prime Minister and Chancellor</a>&nbsp;setting out ideas on how it can support the Government&rsquo;s growth mission.</li>
<li>On 25 March 2025, the FCA published its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-launches-5-year-strategy-support-growth-and-improve-lives" title="FCA launches 5-year strategy to support growth and improve lives">strategy for 2025-2030</a>.&nbsp;</li>

<title>Invest Hong Kong Seminar Promotes In-Depth Exchanges Between FinTech Enterprises And Investment Community</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/invest-hong-kong-seminar-promotes-in-depth-exchanges-between-fintech-enterprises-2025710/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The ​Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) seminar&ndash;Meeting Our Leading VCs in Hong Kong&ndash;has concluded, gathering over 200 fintech enterprise founders, venture capital (VC) leaders and industry experts to help inject new vitality into the future prosperity of Hong Kong&rsquo;s fintech ecosystem.</p>
<p>InvestHK has been linking global fintech enterprises with local and international capital resources. Hong Kong&rsquo;s capital environment has shown strong vitality and new opportunities recently. The Government is providing public funding support and introducing measures to accelerate the development of fintech and related areas such as Web3 and AI. Moreover, as of the end of June 2025, the investment amount brought by the New Capital Investment Entrant Scheme into Hong Kong is expected to be over HK$46.4 billion, reinforcing Hong Kong&rsquo;s standing as a pre-eminent international investment hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For private capital, Hong Kong&rsquo;s advantages are becoming increasingly prominent. Hong Kong has the second-largest capital pool in the Asia-Pacific region, after only the Mainland, with managed private equity funds over US$233.9 billion as of the first half of 2024. As the largest hedge fund centre and cross-border wealth management centre in Asia, Hong Kong continues to attract global capital. Since the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government issued the Policy Statement on Developing Family Office Businesses in Hong Kong, the family office business has developed rapidly. There are more than 2 700 single-family offices operating in Hong Kong, and the scale of managed assets continues to rise. New listing volumes on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong jumped around eight times to US$14 billion in the first half of 2025, fully demonstrating the attractiveness of Hong Kong's financial market.</p>
<p>This seminar created a valuable opportunity for start-ups and growing enterprises to connect with well-known VC leaders. At the seminar, experienced investors shared market patterns and trends in Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, the Middle East and other markets. For VCs, through the Global Fast Track programme and the invitation-only online business matching platform Fast-Track Connect, they have accelerated access to high-quality deal flows and strengthened strategic investment networks.</p>
<p>Director of MindWorks Capital Mr Jeffrey Wu highlighted Hong Kong&rsquo;s unique advantages for fintech startups, namely a transparent regulatory regime, deep offshore capital markets, and a trusted legal system, which make it an ideal springboard for regional and global expansion. Founding Partner of Wings Capital Ventures Mr Jonathan Wu said that as connectivity between Mainland and Hong Kong continues to accelerate, demand for cross-boundary financial services is growing at a remarkable pace. The Mainland&rsquo;s strengths, including its abundant software development resources and rapid innovation cycles paired with Hong Kong&rsquo;s international market and diverse application scenarios, create a promising synergy.</p>
<p>The Managing Partner of 01Fintech Limited, Mr Kenny Man, emphasised that the Southeast Asian market has huge potential, and fintech enterprises should seize the opportunity to expand their business there. He also noted that the event provided valuable exposure to high-potential fintech innovations, reinforcing Hong Kong&rsquo;s role as a global fintech hub with rich cross-border opportunities. These insights provide valuable reference for 01Fintech's investment strategy in the region. Founding General Partner of Transcend Capital Partners Ms Winnie Leung also mentioned that Hong Kong is truly where East meets West, offering a vibrant fusion of cultures and business opportunities. With a substantial amount of capital available, it stands as an ideal hub for exciting venture capital projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the Head of FinTech of Cyberport, Mr Victor Yim, shared the experiences and achievements of Cyberport in supporting fintech and Web3 enterprises. The Senior Manager, New Ventures Development of Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks Corporation (HKSTPC), Ms Josephine Chan, introduced the innovative resources and development platforms provided by HKSTPC for enterprises.</p>
<p>The Global Head of Financial Services, FinTech &amp; Sustainability at InvestHK, Mr King Leung, concluded, &ldquo;This seminar has not only built a bridge for exchanges and co-operation among Hong Kong&rsquo;s fintech industry, it has also brought new impetus to shape the global fintech funding landscape. Through seminars like this, enterprises and investors can conduct in-depth exchanges, jointly seize market opportunities, and achieve mutual benefits and win-win results. This promotes the development of the fintech industry and further consolidates Hong Kong&rsquo;s leading position in the global fintech field. We will continue to organise such high-quality activities, both online and offline, to contribute to the development of the industry.&rdquo;</p>

<title>Shifting Payment Landscape: What A Digital Euro Will Bring - Speech By Piero Cipollone, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, At Banka Slovenije</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is a pleasure to speak to you today.</p>
<p>The ongoing shift in the way we pay is affecting the fundamental fabric of our economies. Whether we are consumers browsing digital marketplaces, entrepreneurs pursuing digital innovation, or decision-makers facing the digital transition, we are all involved in reshaping payments.</p>
<p>Payments are more than a means of settling transactions, they are the lifeblood of a modern economy. And in a digital world, our economies will only be as competitive, inclusive, autonomous and resilient as our payments are.</p>
<p>Slovenia has put the digital transformation at the heart of its economic strategy, aiming to place the country among the top five most digitalised economies in Europe by 2030.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;An innovative and striving digital payments ecosystem can play a key role in this journey.</p>
<p>As a central bank, our responsibility is to accompany and enable this transition. We must ensure that the shift to digital payments enhances accessibility and efficiency, without creating fragmentation or new dependencies.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Let me be clear upfront: this does not mean abandoning cash. Cash serves us well, providing a European means of payment that is accessible, accepted throughout the euro area and continuously available. People remain attached to cash for good reasons, and we are committed to continuing to provide it.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In fact, we will soon start preparations for a third series of euro banknotes which will bear a new design.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>But cash cannot be used for online payments, which represent a growing share of our day-to-day transactions. So we need to extend its benefits to the digital sphere. By introducing a digital euro we would aim to offer a digital equivalent of cash, which preserves Europeans&rsquo; freedom to pay with sovereign money, is free for basic use, preserves privacy, fosters resilience and is accepted throughout the euro area, for any digital payment.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In preparing for a digital euro, we are carrying out one of our core tasks as defined in the Treaty: providing a means of payment with legal tender status and issuing money as a public good.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Given this fundamental role, if we were the only player in payments that did not go digital, it would be fair to question whether we would be fulfilling our mandate. By preparing for a digital euro, we are simply adapting to evolving technologies and preferences.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>This is particularly important in a monetary union like the euro area<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span>, where 25 years after the launch of the euro, we still lack a European solution that enables people to pay digitally throughout the euro area and for all types of payments. And it is especially relevant today, at a time when dependencies on non-European solutions could be weaponised.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>A digital euro would be a public-private cooperation, with European payment service providers playing a key role in its distribution. This would allow them to retain fees and data and would also enable banks to maintain client relationships. By contrast, these relationships could be threatened by payment solutions that seek to bypass banks, such as stablecoins which are currently dominated by non-bank and non-European issuers and mostly denominated in dollars.</p>
<p>Moreover, a digital euro would enable payment service providers to scale up and offer their solutions throughout the euro area by leveraging the digital euro&rsquo;s infrastructure and acceptance network. This would remedy the current state of digital payments, which is a case in point of the situation described by Mario Draghi, namely that the fragmentation of the European market along national lines prevents European firms from being competitive on a European level, let alone globally.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>In my remarks today, I will first explore the challenges presented by the current digital transition in payments. I will then explain how the digital euro offers opportunities to address them.</p>
<h2>The shifting landscape for payments</h2>
<p>Slovenia offers an appealing snapshot of the transformation which is under way in many European economies. Slovenians are still deeply attached to cash: in 2024 nearly two-thirds (64%) of payments at physical locations in Slovenia were made in cash. Yet digitalisation has been advancing steadily, with the share of card payments at physical locations rising to 29% in 2024, up from 19% in 2016.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>This development is not unique to Slovenia. Across the euro area, increasing digitalisation means that online shopping now accounts for over a third of day-to-day retail transactions, while cash payments have fallen to just 24% in value terms.</p>
<p>This shift underscores the importance for us as central banks to not only safeguard trust in money in physical form, but increasingly in digital form too. Our robust defence of cash stems directly from our mandate to issue money that Europeans can use and access throughout the euro area for their day-to-day transactions.</p>
<p>In fact, our work on the digital euro follows logically from our defence of cash. In a world where cash cannot be used for e-commerce transactions and where people also increasingly prefer to pay digitally at physical locations, we must provide a digital equivalent of cash. This will preserve the freedom of Europeans to pay, knowing that a digital euro will be accepted wherever they can opt to pay digitally. And it will allow merchants to reconcile their customers&rsquo; preference to pay digitally with the benefits of cash as a means of payment that protects them from excessive fees and network disruptions.</p>
<p>If we failed to act, we would not only be failing to fulfil our mandate, we would also risk the digital transformation reversing the progress we have made with euro cash. At present we have no sovereign and inclusive digital means of payment with legal tender status. As a result, the growing use of digital payments risks entrenching our dependency on a small number of private non-European players, subjecting our money to the kindness of strangers. This dependency already results in higher fees for merchants and the transfer of taxpayers&rsquo; money &ndash; in the form of lost seigniorage &ndash; outside of Europe.</p>
<p>So today I would like to emphasise three major challenges posed by the ongoing transformation.</p>
<p>The first is that the increased use of digital payments results in a growing reliance on non-European payment providers, which is cause for concern. Two-thirds of card-based transactions in the euro area are processed by international schemes. Some 13 euro area countries are entirely dependent on non-European systems for payments.</p>
<p>Slovenia is a case in point. Despite efforts to promote local schemes, the Slovenian payments ecosystem remains reliant on international card schemes, which dominate the market.</p>
<p>This dependency on non-European payment solutions means that decisions taken outside Europe could affect European consumers&rsquo; ability to seamlessly conduct everyday digital transactions, hindering Europe&rsquo;s strategic autonomy.</p>
<p>The second challenge is the persistent fragmentation of the European payments market.</p>
<p>Despite the clear benefits of integration, banks have not managed to unite the market. The lack of compelling commercial incentives, especially given the profitability and deep-rooted nature of national payment schemes, has discouraged investment in a pan-European solution. Additionally, coordination among banks, each with distinct interests, priorities and legacy investments, has proven difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And even when the infrastructure and a European scheme are in place, like the TARGET instant payment settlement (TIPS) infrastructure and the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer scheme, we have not seen the emergence of pan-European instant account-to-account payment solutions at the point of sale. European providers do not have the incentive or the capacity to invest in competitive, user-friendly front-end solutions across the euro area.</p>
<p>For example, Slovenia&rsquo;s instant payment scheme, Flik, offers a promising user experience across various payment situations. However, its reach remains limited because it is only available to customers of Slovenian banks, excluding non-residents and domestic users of foreign banks. Moreover, merchant acceptance of Flik does not yet match that of traditional card payments, partly because its customer base is still limited. This reflects a vicious circle where limited acceptance discourages adoption and low adoption disincentivises acceptance by merchants. As well as reducing competition, this makes it impossible to scale up the solutions offered by payment service providers that are unable to massively invest in a European-wide acceptance network.</p>
<p>Instead, as the use of digital payments increases, we are left with a patchwork of domestic solutions that lack the reach and scale to compete effectively across the EU &ndash; and sometimes not even at the national level. In Slovenia, Karanta, a national scheme backed by the largest domestic bank, had a market share of just 0.20% in 2024.</p>
<p>This fragmentation is not just inefficient; it makes digital payments more expensive and less convenient than they could be, placing an unnecessary burden on both consumers and merchants. It is estimated that merchants across the euro area pay around &euro;3 billion every year to process international debit cards.</p>
<p>The third challenge relates to the user experience offered by existing solutions. In Slovenia, for example, consumers are forced to use multiple apps, cards and platforms to make payments, resulting in a fragmented and often frustrating experience.</p>
<p>These issues are not specific to Slovenia. They reflect a wider European challenge: the lack of a European-wide acceptance network for an open digital payment infrastructure that matches the reality of our increasingly digital and interconnected economies.</p>
<h2>A digital euro for everyday payments</h2>
<p>In light of these challenges, we need to ensure that the benefits of digital payments are enjoyed by all, while at the same time safeguarding our sovereignty and the trust that underpins our single currency.</p>
<p>A digital euro would ensure that central bank money remains universally accessible for everyday transactions, not just in physical form, but also digitally. It would guarantee that citizens can pay anywhere in the euro area using a trusted, risk-free instrument issued by the Eurosystem. This is consistent with the Eurosystem&rsquo;s mandate under the EU Treaties to issue the only means of payment that has legal tender status. A digital euro would be a modern expression of monetary sovereignty.</p>
<p>And let me say it again: the digital euro is not intended to replace cash. It would complement it. We recognise that people across the euro area, and especially in Slovenia, are strongly attached to cash. It remains a vital tool for inclusion, personal freedom and resilience. We are unwavering in our commitment to cash.</p>
<p>At the same time, our responsibility as a central bank is to ensure that, as payments become increasingly digital, citizens can continue to benefit from the trust and security that public money provides. In the long run, maintaining a direct link to a central bank-issued means of payment that is usable at the point of sale across all use cases may be essential in preserving trust in commercial bank money.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.12" id="fn12">12</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, without a public digital alternative, consumers and merchants would be increasingly dependent on the terms, prices, and data practices set by a few, mostly non-European, private actors. For instance, over the past few years the average net merchant service charges in the EU have nearly doubled, despite regulatory efforts to contain them.</p>
<p>Introducing a digital euro would provide an attractive alternative to foreign payment solutions and is the only way to ensure Europe&rsquo;s monetary sovereignty. It would guarantee that the euro can always be used for digital payments anywhere in the euro area, ensuring that Europeans retain the freedom to make transactions seamlessly and securely, independent of decisions taken outside the EU.</p>
<p>Moreover, the digital euro would address the persistent fragmentation that is hampering the retail payments market. The lack of incentives and coordination among European banks to develop a continent-wide solution for payments at the point of sale is understandable but hard to overcome, given the significant investments that are needed to challenge entrenched foreign providers, their acceptance network and their proprietary standards. Instead, national payment solutions remain dependent on non-European firms to offer a comparable in-shop payment experience, as is the case for cross-border or tap-to-pay payments, for example.</p>
<p>So, just as the introduction of euro banknotes united Europe 23 years ago and brought tangible benefits to its citizens, the digital euro has the potential to create a truly integrated digital payments landscape that preserves the two-tier payment system and the healthy equilibrium between public and private money that has served us so well for so long.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.13" id="fn13">13</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;As central bank money, it would have legal tender status, meaning it would be accepted everywhere, instantly generating powerful network effects. Leveraging its open standards and acceptance network would give European payment providers the scale and certainty they need to innovate and expand.</p>
<p>This would also benefit banks who are currently losing fees and data to the dominant international payment solutions and could soon also lose deposits to stablecoins, which are dominated by non-European firms and are denominated in US dollars for 99% of their value.</p>
<p>For European payment service providers, establishing common standards through the digital euro would enable platforms such as Flik to extend their reach domestically and to operate across all euro area countries from the outset, just as easily as national schemes do within national borders. This would open up the market to fairer competition, forcing established players to adjust the costs they impose on merchants, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises. Consumers would ultimately benefit through lower prices.</p>
<p>We are designing the digital euro platform in such a way that it expands the range of possible conditional payments &ndash; think of automatic reimbursements in the event of train or flight delays, for example. This will increase choice and stimulate innovation, leading to a richer and more user-friendly experience for everyone. The digital euro would rely on a new settlement ledger, intended to support advanced payment functionalities, including conditional payments. Our prototyping and experimentation have shown that such payments can be implemented by leveraging application programming interfaces &ndash; or APIs as they&rsquo;re known. In recent months we have partnered with some 70 merchants, fintech companies, start-ups, banks and other payment service providers, including from Slovenia, to explore the potential of the digital euro to drive innovation. We will share our findings soon.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.14" id="fn14">14</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The digital euro would offer a comprehensive and smooth user experience for consumers that covers all use cases: payments in shops, online and between individuals. It would provide integrated online and offline functionalities all while upholding the highest privacy standards. The offline functionality would offer cash-like privacy, with transaction details known only to the payer and the payee.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250710~7d5aeae662.en.html#footnote.15" id="fn15">15</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;Such an all-in-one solution does not currently exist, and its introduction would mark a significant step forward for Europe.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Let me conclude.</p>
<p>Building an agile and robust digital payments ecosystem is essential for Europe&rsquo;s digital transformation. Ignoring this task risks further fragmentation and dependencies, resulting in a less convenient and more costly payment experience for consumers and merchants, including in Slovenia.</p>
<p>The digital euro offers a solution: a European public good that will complement cash, ensuring trust, sovereignty, and universal access to secure, cost-free payments across the euro area. It will empower people and businesses in Slovenia and beyond to transact easily and safely, online and offline, at home and across borders. And it will allow European private payment solutions to scale up and become more competitive.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the digital euro is more than a currency innovation &ndash; it is a public commitment to the future of Europe&rsquo;s digital economy. It embodies our shared values of openness, resilience and fairness, ensuring that as our economies evolve, no one is left behind and that Europe remains in control of its monetary destiny.</p>

<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-introduction field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>The European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), the EU&rsquo;s financial markets regulator and supervisor, published today the results of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2025-07/ESMA42-2004696504-8164_Fast-track_peer_review_on_a_CASP_authorisation_and_supervision_in_Malta.pdf">peer review</a>&nbsp;looking at the authorisation of Crypto Asset Service Providers (CASPs) in Malta under the Market in Crypto Assets Regulation (MICA).</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-field-news-body field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__item">
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The peer review analyses the approaches adopted by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA) in the authorisation and early supervision of a CASP and provides recommendations to strengthen these processes. It identifies overall a good level of resources and supervisory engagement within the authority, with some areas for improvement related to the assessment of authorisations.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Key findings:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Some material issues where not fully resolved when MFSA granted the CASP authorisation;</span></li>
<li><span>Some risks areas were not adequately assessed during the authorisation process;</span></li>
<li><span>The MFSA has demonstrated a good level of expertise and supervisory cooperation.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The peer review also recommends to all NCAs currently in the process of authorising CASPs to pay particular attention to certain areas of risk, including business growth,&nbsp;conflicts of interests, governance and intragroup arrangements, ICT architecture, Web3, decentralised products, and the promotion of unregulated services.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>While focused on an individual case, the review aims to foster the sound authorisation of CASPs by all NCAs in the EU. Its conclusions should be on-boarded by all NCAs to ensure that the authorisations they grant are well assessed in this new and high-risk sector, where supervisory knowledge is still being built.</span></p>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>This exercise is also an opportunity to reinforce EU supervisors&rsquo; role as gatekeepers of the EU single market in the crypto space.</span></p>
<h4 class="text-align-justify"><span><span>Next steps</span></span></h4>
<p class="text-align-justify"><span>The objective of peer reviews is to enhance convergence and harmonisation in the process across the EU, and the NCAs are expected to integrate the recommendations in their internal processes, as well as in their on-going and future authorisations. ESMA will continue promoting further discussion on the recommendations and cross border cooperation.</span></p>

<p>Following a&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUtTAwZQAFFXWkxYVwQHHVZcUVAdC1tQVxoAXFEHAVEDB1MBBwcdU1ZWAAoBBFsdAwgNBB0GDABTGlcABw4ZAwdVDwMHAAdSVFYERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">consultation process</a>&nbsp;launched in March 2025,&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEAA9TWFgBWkwPB1VUHVYKAwYdUAEDUBpTVlEBUQECAlJVBlcdU1ZWAAoBBFsdAwgNBB0GDABTGlcABw4ZAwdVDwMHAAdSVFYERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">ACER has concluded</a>&nbsp;that implementing peak-shaving products in the EU electricity market under normal conditions would bring more challenges than advantages.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What are peak-shaving products?</span></p>
<p>Peak-shaving products are market-based tools that enable market participants to reduce their electricity consumption (during peak demand periods) in exchange for compensation.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsEB1ADWVVRBkxYBwEBHVZaAA4dUFxVURoEUAtWUAQNUw8IUFAdU1ZWAAoBBFsdAwgNBB0GDABTGlcABw4ZAwdVDwMHAAdSVFYERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Electricity Market Design (EMD) Regulation</a>, the Council of the EU can declare a regional or EU-wide crisis if wholesale electricity prices become excessively high. In such cases, Member States can direct system operators to use peak-shaving products to reduce power demand, helping stabilise the grid and lower prices.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why an ACER assessment?</span></p>
<p>ACER was mandated to assess the potential impact of developing peak-shaving products on Europe&rsquo;s electricity market under normal (e.g. non-crisis) conditions.

<div class="row-with-description ">
<div class="text-highlight">
<ul class="rte--list">
<li>Following recent European regulatory changes and strategic evaluation Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group sees potential for reducing regulatory complexity and increasing efficiency.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Eurex Clearing AG considers returning its banking license and prepares for direct access to the revised Eurosystem overnight credit facility for CCPs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Clearstream Banking AG in Frankfurt considers returning their banking license based on recent amendments of the CSD Regulation.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row-with-picture">
<div class="detailText">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following recent regulatory developments, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group currently evaluates and prepares steps to reduce regulatory complexity and increase efficiency. This concerns specifically the re-evaluation of the banking licenses of Eurex Clearing AG and Clearstream Banking AG.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group welcomes the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2025/html/ecb.pr250430_1~db4f08259e.en.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">related announcement</a>&nbsp;by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) on 30 April 2025 to remove the discretionary activation for Central Counterparty (CCP) access to overnight credit under the Target guideline.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eurex Clearing AG, the leading central counterparty in the Euro area, intends to make use of the revised Eurosystem overnight credit facility for CCPs. The CCP facility is intended to provide access to Central Bank liquidity during stressed market conditions.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the ECB&rsquo;s announcement and still subject to the ECB's final decision and terms granting CCPs access to the dedicated overnight credit facility, Eurex Clearing has started preparations to access the CCP facility and return its banking license, which would be no longer required. The new set-up will have no impact on the status of Eurex Clearing AG as a licensed CCP under EMIR.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Further, Clearstream Banking AG will be able to focus on its core business as a Central Securities Depository (CSD) for new issuance services, safekeeping, asset servicing, and settlement resulting out of the regulatory changes brought by amendments made to the CSD Regulation (CSDR Refit). Against this background, but subject to certain operational requirements and approval by the competent authorities for the new set-up, Clearstream Banking AG, the German CSD, also intends to return its banking license.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearstream Banking S.A., the Luxembourg licensed ICSD, will continue to leverage its CRR license (Capital Requirements Regulation) for Commercial Bank Money settlements and function as the Service CSD of the Group following CSDR refit.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stephan Leithner, CEO of Deutsche B&ouml;rse Group, commented: "As a full-service Financial Market Infrastructure group, we continually seek opportunities to reduce regulatory complexity and increase efficiency. This is beneficial not only for our clients and shareholders, but also for the broader financial ecosystem. We welcome in this context the efforts for simplification and global competitiveness undertaken at European level. We are engaged in a constructive dialogue with our regulators to identify solutions that preserve the safety and integrity of our services and processes for our clients, while simultaneously simplifying structures and improving efficiency."&nbsp;</p>

<title>SIX And Pictet Complete Pilot Project To Tokenize And Fractionalize Financial Assets, Enabling Increased Customisation</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-and-pictet-complete-pilot-project-to-tokenize-and-fractionalize-financial-as-2025710/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/six-and-pictet-complete-pilot-project-to-tokenize-and-fractionalize-financial-as-2025710/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Today, SIX and Banque Pictet &amp; Cie SA have announced the successful conclusion of a joint pilot project, tokenising corporate debt instruments and allocating fractional quantities of these assets to portfolios managed by Pictet Asset Management SA. This initiative demonstrates the potential of tokenized securities which will offer more flexible, efficient, and scalable tools for delivering tailored investment solutions to Asset Managers. This work paves the way for broader adoption of digital infrastructure and acts as an important starting point for the mutual funds industry.</span></p>
<p>While mutual funds have long served investors, the emergence of digital securities introduces a fundamental upgrade, allowing investors to have greater control of investment choices with improved operational efficiency.</p>
<p>The pilot project focused on EUR- and CHF-denominated corporate bonds, held in custody at SIX SIS to be tokenized on the SDX platform. These were then allocated in fractions to the investors via the portfolios&lsquo; custody bank account, enabling a level of portfolio customisation which would not be easily achievable via traditional systems. A key benefit is that the solution can be utilised for all debt instruments (both traditional and digitally issued).</p>
<p>This pilot supports new operating models for mutual fund management, including more tailored investment strategies and improved diversification for smaller investments, supported by automated fractionalised portfolio rebalancing. Tokenisation broadens access to asset classes such as corporate bonds by facilitating smaller investment sizes that attract a more diverse range of investors.</p>
<p><span>David Newns, Head SDX</span>, said: &nbsp;&ldquo;We are delighted that our successful pilot project with Pictet has established a foundation for integrating digital bonds into fund portfolios. This milestone marks the first successful fractionalization of securities on regulated blockchain-based financial market infrastructure in production. Tokenized securities combined with fractionalization on SDX enables more flexible, efficient, and inclusive financial services, allowing asset managers and financial institutions to unlock real value from digital assets.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Olivier Ginguen&eacute;, Chief Investment Officer Multi Asset &amp; Quantitative Investment at Pictet Asset Management</span>, said: "We are pleased to collaborate with SIX on this breakthrough project. It is the first time that tokenisation and fractionalization have been combined in the Swiss market to enable real investments in traditional asset classes such as equities or bonds. A new and innovative use case for tokenized trading of securities that opens up for customisation at scale. We look forward to continuing to be part of their journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The collaboration between SDX and Pictet confirms that tokenized assets combined with fractionalization can deliver real benefits across the fund management value chain, from operational efficiencies to enhanced outcomes and experience for investors.</p>

<title>Project Acacia: RBA And DFCRC Announce Chosen Industry Participants And ASIC Provides Regulatory Relief For Tokenised Asset Settlement Research Project</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/project-acacia-rba-and-dfcrc-announce-chosen-industry-participants-and-asic-pro-2025710/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/project-acacia-rba-and-dfcrc-announce-chosen-industry-participants-and-asic-pro-2025710/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Project Acacia has today reached a significant milestone with a number of industry participants (see below) selected to explore how innovations in digital money and existing settlement infrastructure might support the development of Australian wholesale tokenised asset markets.</p>
<p>Project Acacia is a joint initiative between the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC). This work is also supported by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), and the Australian Treasury. This project is one of the initiatives highlighted in the Government&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://treasury.gov.au/sites/default/files/2025-03/p2025-628504-s.pdf">March 2025 Statement on Developing an Innovative Australian Digital Asset Industry</a>.</p>
<p>24 innovative use cases from a diverse range of organisations, ranging from local fintechs to major banks, have been conditionally selected for this next stage of the project. There will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>19 pilot use cases, which will involve real money and real asset transactions, and</li>
<li>5 proof-of-concept use cases involving simulated transactions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The use cases involve a range of asset classes, including fixed income, private markets, trade receivables and carbon credits.</p>
<p>Proposed settlement assets for the use cases include stablecoins, bank deposit tokens, and pilot wholesale central bank digital currency (CBDC), as well as new ways of using banks&rsquo; existing exchange settlement accounts at the RBA.</p>
<p>Issuance of pilot wholesale CBDC for testing use cases will occur on a range of private and public-permissioned DLT platforms, including Hedera, Redbelly Network, R3 Corda, Canvas Connect and other EVM-compatible networks.</p>
<h2>ASIC clears way for industry participation</h2>
<p>Supporting Project Acacia, ASIC is providing regulatory relief to participants to support and streamline the pilot.</p>
<p>ASIC&rsquo;s relief will support the responsible testing of tokenised asset transactions, in some cases using CBDCs, between participants and a limited number of financial institutions in the coming months.</p>
<p>ASIC has previously provided individual relief of a similar nature to participants in earlier digital money projects led by the RBA.</p>
<p>The relief instrument is available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L00831/asmade/text">Federal Register of Legislation</a>.</p>
<h2>Project Acacia&rsquo;s next steps</h2>
<p>Testing of use cases will occur over the next six months, with a report on the findings from the project expected to be published in the first quarter of 2026. The findings of this next stage of the project will support the RBA&rsquo;s ongoing research into how innovation in the financial system can best support the Australian economy in the digital age.</p>
<h2>Lead use case participants</h2>
<ul>
<li>Australian Bond Exchange</li>
<li>Australia and New Zealand Banking Corporation</li>
<li>Australian Payments Plus</li>
<li>Canvas Connect</li>
<li>Catena Digital</li>
<li>Commonwealth Bank of Australia</li>
<li>Fireblocks</li>
<li>Forte Tech Solutions</li>
<li>Imperium Markets</li>
<li>Northern Trust</li>
<li>NotCentralised</li>
<li>ProspEx Group</li>
<li>Westpac Banking Corporation</li>
<li>Zerocap</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Brad Jones, Assistant Governor (Financial System) at the RBA said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ensuring that Australia&rsquo;s payments and monetary arrangements are fit-for-purpose in the digital age is a strategic priority for the RBA and the Payments System Board. Project Acacia represents an opportunity for further collaborative exploration on tokenised asset markets and the future of money by the public and private sectors in Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The use cases selected in this project will help us to better understand how innovations in central bank and private digital money, alongside payments infrastructure, might help to uplift the functioning of wholesale financial markets in Australia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank all interested parties for their efforts in Project Acacia to date and look forward to reporting back on the findings that will emerge over the reminder of the project.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>ASIC Commissioner Kate O&rsquo;Rourke said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;Innovation is a sign of a vibrant economy and society. ASIC supports the responsible development of new technologies, including tokenisation and distributed ledgers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;ASIC sees useful applications for the technologies underlying digital assets in wholesale markets. The relief from regulatory requirements that we have announced today will allow these technologies to be sensibly tested&mdash;to explore opportunities and identify and tackle risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Importantly, Project Acacia will allow industry and regulators to work together to learn more about how these use cases may reshape the financial services industry, potentially boosting efficiency and foster economic growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Professor Talis Putnins, Chief Scientist at DFCRC said:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;It is great to have collaboration from so many parts of the industry, from small fintechs to large banks, alongside the key financial regulators in this forward-looking, innovative project. The real money settlement models being tested, including issuing pilot wholesale CBDC on third party platforms, reflects another world-first for Australia in this rapidly evolving field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The project is of strategic importance to the DFCRC because, as a co-operative research centre, our focus is on bringing together key groups to unlock the large economic potential of digital finance innovation in Australia. Recent research suggests potential economic gains in markets and cross border payments could be in the order of AU $19 billion per year. Project Acacia is a significant step towards realising these gains, by providing evidence on the forms of money and settlement models that best enable tokenised real-world asset markets.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>About Project Acacia</h2>
<p>Project Acacia is exploring how different forms of digital money and associated infrastructure could support the development of wholesale tokenised asset markets in Australia. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L00831/asmade/text">consultation paper</a>&nbsp;initiating Project Acacia was released in November 2024 and called for industry feedback and expressions of interest in participating.</p>
<p>Project Acacia is a joint research project between Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) and the Digital Finance Cooperative Research Centre (DFCRC). The project is supported by key stakeholders including the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) and the Australian Treasury, which are all represented on the project Steering Committee, along with representatives from the RBA and DFCRC.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission&rsquo;s Division of Enforcement today issued an advisory to provide guidance describing its plan to address criminally liable regulatory offenses in accordance with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/05/14/2025-08681/fighting-overcriminalization-in-federal-regulations"><em>Executive Order 14294, Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations</em></a>.</p>
<p>The advisory announces the framework to be followed when DOE, as the CFTC division responsible for making referrals to the Department of Justice, considers whether to refer potential violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The advisory also includes a set of factors DOE staff should consider when determining whether to refer alleged violations of criminal regulatory offenses to DOJ. Those factors include:&nbsp;</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div>
<p>The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) Superintendent Adrienne A. Harris today and five other state financial regulators have taken coordinated action against New York-based Wise US, Inc. (Wise), for inadequacies in Wise&rsquo;s Bank Secrecy Act/Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism Program (&ldquo;AML/CFT Program&rdquo;). Wise is a subsidiary of Wise PLC, a United Kingdom company. &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;Through collaboration with our valued state partners we will continue to ensure that money transmitters adhere to rigorous standards to protect consumers and the integrity of the financial system,&rdquo;&nbsp;<span>said Superintendent Harris</span>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Strong relationships with state and federal regulators alike is crucial to ensuring a fair, transparent, and resilient financial system that protects consumers and fosters innovation across the country.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;Results like this illustrate the power of collaboration and consistency. State financial regulators have primary licensing and supervisory responsibility for companies engaged in money transmission and have developed a robust nationwide framework for licensing, regulation, and supervision of the industry,&rdquo; said Massachusetts Commissioner Mary L. Gallagher.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;This action highlights the ongoing collaboration between the DFPI and other state regulators to strengthen consumer protection and uphold trust in the financial services industry nationwide,&rdquo; said DFPI Commissioner KC Mohseni. &ldquo;It marks the second significant action this year involving anti-money laundering compliance by money transmitters.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&ldquo;This enforcement action underscores Minnesota&rsquo;s commitment to safeguarding consumers and preserving integrity in our financial services,&rdquo; said Commerce Assistant Commissioner of Enforcement Jacqueline Olson. &ldquo;By working with our partners in other states, we are able to uphold rigorous standards that help prevent bad actors from using money transmitters for illegal activities that hurt everyday Minnesotans.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US">NDBF Director Kelly Lammers said, &ldquo;Our department takes seriously its mission to protect and maintain the public&rsquo;s confidence in the financial industries that do business in Nebraska. When companies fail to comply with the rules for doing business here, we will take appropriate action to safeguard Nebraskans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the multistate settlement signed this week along with regulators from Massachusetts, Texas, California, Minnesota, and Nebraska, Wise agreed to pay a $4.2 million penalty and take a number of corrective actions to remediate deficiencies in its AML/CFT Program, including conducting a lookback for previously closed accounts, enhancing its reporting procedures for suspicious activity, strengthening its due diligence procedures for AML/CFT risk, and improving its systems for data integrity regarding customer accounts. In connection with these efforts, Wise will engage an independent third party to verify corrective actions to the systems have been performed and, for two years, submit quarterly written progress reports to the multistate regulators.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Enchanting, But Not Magical: A Statement On The Tokenization Of Securities, SEC Commissioner Hester M. Peirce, July 9, 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/enchanting-but-not-magical-a-statement-on-the-tokenization-of-securities-sec-202579/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div class="clearfix text-formatted usa-prose field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">
<p>Blockchain technology has unlocked novel models for distributing and trading securities in a &ldquo;tokenized&rdquo; format. Tokenization may facilitate capital formation and enhance investors&rsquo; ability to use their assets as collateral. Enchanted by these possibilities, new entrants and many traditional firms are embracing onchain products. As powerful as blockchain technology is, it does not have magical abilities to transform the nature of the underlying asset. Tokenized securities are still securities. Accordingly, market participants must consider&mdash;and adhere to&mdash;the federal securities laws when transacting in these instruments.</p>
<p>Sometimes an issuer tokenizes its own security. For example, an operating company or an investment company could tokenize its shares. Alternatively, an unaffiliated third party with custody of securities issued by another entity might, for instance, issue a new tokenized security tied to the securities it holds or may tokenize the &ldquo;security entitlements&rdquo; that investors hold against the custodian. Purchasers of these third-party tokens may face unique risks, such as counterparty risks.</p>
<p>Distributors of tokenized securities must consider their disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws and may wish to refer to the Division of Corporation Finance&rsquo;s recent staff statement on this topic.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-tokenized-securities-070925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Market participants who distribute, purchase, and trade tokenized securities also should consider the nature of these securities and the resulting securities laws implications. For example, depending on the particular facts and circumstances, a token could be a &ldquo;receipt for a security,&rdquo; which is itself a security but is distinct from the underlying security held by the distributor of the token. Alternatively, a token that does not provide the holder with legal and beneficial ownership of the underlying security could be a &ldquo;security-based swap&rdquo; that cannot be traded off exchange by retail persons. While blockchain-based tokenization is new, the process of issuing an instrument representing a security is not. The same legal requirements apply to on- and off-chain versions of these instruments.</p>
<p>Market participants, as they structure their tokenization product offerings, should consider meeting with the Commission and its staff.<a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/peirce-statement-tokenized-securities-070925?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;When unique aspects of a technology warrant changes to existing rules or where regulatory requirements are outdated or unnecessary, we stand ready to work with market participants to craft appropriate exemptions and modernize rules.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fragmentation in global financial regulation puts competition, economic growth and financial system resilience at risk, says a&nbsp;<a href="https://bpi.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/The-Costs-of-Fragmentation-and-Possible-Solutions-2025.07.08.pdf" target="_blank">joint paper</a>&nbsp;published today by the Bank Policy Institute, GFMA and the Institute of International Finance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fragmentation resulting from miscalibration of global standards or excessive regulatory and supervisory divergence can trap capital, liquidity and risk in local markets; create significant financial and operational inefficiencies resulting in additional unnecessary costs to end-users; reduce the capacity of financial firms to serve both domestic and international customers; and may increase fragility, making markets more brittle and less resilient,&rdquo; the trades wrote in the paper.</p>
<p>A 2018 OECD survey estimated that a piecemeal approach to financial sector regulation costs the global economy about $780 billion each year. The World Economic Forum estimates that fragmentation could reduce global output by as much as $5.7 trillion annually, depending on the degree of fragmentation. That&rsquo;s equivalent to 5% of world GDP and twice the losses seen during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Global standard-setters, including the Financial Stability Board, International Organization of Securities Commissions and others, initiated a review in 2018 to identify ways to address market fragmentation. Yet despite these efforts, fragmentation continues to increase.</p>
<p><span>Four recommendations to address fragmentation:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Identify policies that force subsidiarization</span>. The International Monetary Fund, FSB and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision should identify national rules that require financial institutions to establish local subsidiaries or restrict branch operations.</li>
<li><span>Reassess ring-fencing requirements.&nbsp;</span>Jurisdictions with ring-fencing requirements should review whether those rules are properly calibrated considering the post-crisis resolution framework, including resolution planning and enhanced loss absorbency requirements.</li>
<li><span>Improve global coordination and cooperation</span>. Global standard-setters and regulators should work with industry and among themselves to address fragmentation and risks introduced by inconsistencies.</li>
<li><span>Re-evaluate supervisory colleges and case management groups</span>. The FSB should re-evaluate the functioning of international colleges and case management groups. These groups are supposed to bring together regulators from different countries to oversee global financial institutions, and it would be useful to examine these initiatives and whether they are meeting this goal effectively.</li>
</ol>

<title>Ontario Securities Commission Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization Report Highlights Sales Culture Concerns At Canada’s Largest Bank-Affiliated Dealers</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-report-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ontario-securities-commission-canadian-investment-regulatory-organization-report-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) and the Canadian Investment Regulatory Organization (CIRO) have published their report;&nbsp;<a class="ext" href="https://www.osc.ca/en/news-events/reports-and-publications/sales-culture-concerns-five-canadas-bank-affiliated-dealers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_self">Sales Culture Concerns at Five of Canada&rsquo;s Bank-Affiliated Dealers</a>.The report presents survey results from nearly 3,000 mutual fund dealing representatives from five of Canada&rsquo;s largest bank affiliated dealers. The survey focused on the sales environment, sales pressure, range of products, and knowledge of representatives.</p>
<p>The responses from representatives showed some positive perceptions &ndash; including that they felt the range of products was satisfactory for their clients; even if many thought a broader range would also be beneficial. However, the results did identify areas of concern for the OSC and CIRO.</p>
<p>This includes one in four representatives across banks stating that clients have been recommended products or services that are not in their interests at least &ldquo;sometimes&rdquo;. Forty percent of representatives believe scorecards (a means of tracking performance against target measures, including sales targets and/or activity-based targets) influence product and service recommendations to clients. One in three representatives also reported that clients have been provided with incorrect information about products and services being recommended to them. The OSC and CIRO believe the sales environment, compensation, incentivization, and performance tracking may be contributing factors to these results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s clear many bank representatives are prioritizing quality advice, it is also clear that sales pressures and incentivization may be driving concerning behaviours,&rdquo; said Grant Vingoe, CEO of the OSC. &ldquo;The focus of the bank representatives should be the best interests of their customers and clients &ndash; not feeling heightened pressures to meet sales targets. We look forward to continuing our work to address these concerns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our mission is to promote healthy capital markets by regulating fairly and effectively so that investors are protected and confident investing in their futures. Through continued transparency and cooperation, we can achieve this and ensure that Canadians feel at ease when they are planning for their financial futures,&rdquo; said Andrew J. Kriegler, President and CEO of CIRO. &ldquo;The results from the survey identified areas where more work is needed and we appreciate the cooperation and willingness of the banks to participate and share our ambition to do what&rsquo;s right for investors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next phase of this work will include obtaining an understanding of the sales practices in place and also to understand the controls the dealers have in place to address any material conflicts of interest arising from sales practices.</p>
<p>The mandate of the OSC is to provide protection to investors from unfair, improper or fraudulent practices, to foster fair, efficient and competitive capital markets and confidence in the capital markets, to foster capital formation, and to contribute to the stability of the financial system and the reduction of systemic risk.

<title>Tariff Wars And Geopolitical Uncertainty Reshapes European CFOs Strategies, Lucanet CFO Panel Finds - Amid Global Volatility, CFO Experts Embrace Data-Driven Scenario Modelling, With 66% Prioritising Digital Transformation To Boost Resilience</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/solutions/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=cpm-uk-brand&amp;utm_term=lucanet&amp;keyword=lucanet&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA0--6BhCBARIsADYqyL-bl-Cvv1QC-Efedrkmzc667LFVtKe9ocuI83vjByAKYsHWylt3TwkaAnd1EALw_wcB">Lucanet</a>, the leading global provider of end-to-end CFO software solutions, today announced the launch of its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/resource-hub/analysts-reports/finance-leadership-panel/">Lucanet 2025 Finance Leadership Panel Report</a>, that reveals a clear shift in the CFO role, fuelled by ongoing geopolitical upheaval and trade conflicts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Featuring 35 European finance leaders, the report shows that CFOs are evolving to become strategic growth drivers, backed by continuous, data-driven forecasting and tech-led transformation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The findings highlight three major shifts in CFO strategies; their top priorities being real-time scenario modelling&ndash;with 66% focusing on digital transformation to bolster resilience, digital and AI-led transformation, and enterprise-wide collaboration.</p>
<p>The report launches ahead of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lucanet.com/en/lucanet-world-2025/">Lucanet World 2025</a>, Lucanet&rsquo;s flagship summit, where over 700 professionals from finance, tech, risk, tax and sustainability will gather in Berlin on July 9-10 to explore how CFOs can lead through complexity and redefine the future of finance.</p>
<h4><span>Real-time scenario modelling replaces static planning&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>While 60% of panellists describe the economic outlook as negative or very negative, the mood is pragmatic, not panicked. Static annual budgets are being replaced by rolling, driver-based forecasts with micro-scenarios that enable faster, smarter pivots: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re focused on reducing costs, improving agility of operations to respond quickly to fast changing market demands,&rdquo; said one finance chief.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span>Digital and AI-led transformation accelerates agility&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>To enable this real-time strategic agility, two-thirds (66%) of CFOs name digital transformation as their top priority in 2025. Revealing that tech transformation has become a key part of the CFO role, 74% of panelists confirmed they have investments in data management and data integration lined up, with more than half (54%) of those planning projects taking place in the next 12 months.</p>
<p>AI is a key driver in this shift. Panellists are leveraging the technology to automate repetitive tasks, as well as boosting scenario planning by speeding up data processing and enhancing accuracy: &ldquo;[AI is] a powerful tool for improving decision-making by providing real-time insights, spotting patterns in large data sets, and automating routine tasks &ndash; opening the door to a more strategic, forward-looking finance function,&rdquo; explained one CFO.&nbsp;<span style="color: #023169; font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4><span>Enterprise-wide data sharing fosters holistic business strategy&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h4>
<p>True strategic planning requires a holistic view of the whole company and the panel uncovered that finance leaders are stepping beyond traditional boundaries, collaborating across departments including HR, sales and sustainability to build unified, real-time data-backed insights. &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />As the CFO role expands, core success metrics are evolving to include growth enablement, digital transformation progress, organisational resilience, and increasingly, ESG outcomes, the report finds.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />&ldquo;Far from a box-ticking exercise, ESG is becoming a core metric for CFOs. High ESG scores lead to better financial outcomes, including lower interest rates and stronger investment appeal, making it CFO territory,&rdquo; explains Alistair Gurney, CFO at Lucanet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Today&rsquo;s high-performing CFOs stand out because they&rsquo;ve reimagined finance for a more complex world. They&rsquo;re leveraging advanced, AI-powered extended planning and analysis (xP&amp;A) platforms to guide strategy at speed, under pressure, and with clarity,&rdquo; Gurney continues.</p>
<p>These findings will be unpacked further at Lucanet World 2025, where finance leaders, analysts, and digital transformation experts will come together to share strategies and insights on navigating economic uncertainty, accelerating tech adoption, and reshaping the finance function. For more information and to register see&nbsp;<a href="https://registration.lucanet.world/lucanetworld25/register">here</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beyond the software, at Lucanet we&rsquo;re building a CFO community,&rdquo; adds Gurney. &ldquo;This panel gave us a window into the real-world challenges and priorities facing CFOs today. By bringing together these perspectives in the report and continuing the conversation at Lucanet World, we&rsquo;re proud to be helping shape the modern CFO office.&rdquo;</p>

<title>The Bank Of England Fines Vocalink Limited £11,900,000 For A Compliance Failure</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-fines-vocalink-limited-11900000-for-a-compliance-failure-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-bank-of-england-fines-vocalink-limited-11900000-for-a-compliance-failure-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Bank of England (the &ldquo;Bank&rdquo;) has fined Vocalink Limited (&ldquo;Vocalink&rdquo;) &pound;11,900,000 in respect of a compliance failure under section 196 of the Banking Act 2009 (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). This is the first time the Bank has fined a&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk202363938"></a>financial market infrastructure firm. Vocalink has been regulated by the Bank since April 2018 as a specified service provider, a type of financial market infrastructure firm involved in the operation of UK payments systems.</p>
<p>Vocalink was required by the Bank to remediate a number of identified systems and controls issues via a direction issued under section 191 of the Act (the &ldquo;Direction&rdquo;). Vocalink implemented a remediation programme in response and had until 28 February 2022 to comply with the Direction&rsquo;s requirements. However, an ineffective risk management framework, combined with weaknesses in its controls, governance arrangements and escalation processes meant that it failed to comply in full with the Direction&rsquo;s requirements by the deadline.</p>
<p><span>Sarah Breeden, Deputy Governor for Financial Stability, said</span>:<br /><br />&ldquo;Vocalink fell short of its obligation to have adequate risk management and governance arrangements when responding to the Bank&rsquo;s Direction. Its failure to comply with that Direction in full has resulted in a significant fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk195609481"></a>The Bank&rsquo;s investigation identified the root cause of Vocalink&rsquo;s non-compliance was the failure to have in place a sufficiently integrated risk management framework for the remediation programme. This would have ensured that risks facing the programme could be properly understood, monitored and shared amongst the three lines of defence (and external assurance providers). It also found there were failures to escalate key risks and information to senior committees, which undermined the firm&rsquo;s ability to fully comply with the Direction. The Bank considers Vocalink&rsquo;s governance arrangements fell below the standards expected of a financial market infrastructure firm.</p>
<p><a id="_Hlk201048372"></a>The Firm has invested significantly in remediating the issues which led to both the Direction being issued and the subsequent compliance failure.</p>
<p>Vocalink&rsquo;s cooperation throughout the investigation, including the early admission of a compliance failure, resulted in a 15% reduction to the penalty. Vocalink agreed to resolve the matter and therefore qualified for a further 30% reduction in the fine. Without these reductions, the fine imposed by the Bank would have been &pound;20,000,000.</p>

<title>FSB Publishes Recommendations To Address Financial Stability Risks Created By Leverage In Nonbank Financial Intermediation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><span>Leverage recommendations give authorities flexibility to select, design and calibrate measures that best address financial stability risks created by NBFI leverage in their jurisdiction, while considering potential adverse effects.</span></li>
<li><span>NBFI progress report highlights the FSB&rsquo;s shift from policymaking to monitoring NBFI vulnerabilities, addressing data challenges, sharing members&rsquo; insights and policy approaches, and evaluating policy implementation.</span></li>
<li><span>A Nonbank Data Task Force, chaired by FSB Chair Andrew Bailey, is assessing ways to address key nonbank data challenges through a test case on leveraged trading strategies in sovereign bond markets.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) today published three reports related to its work programme to enhance resilience in nonbank financial intermediation (NBFI).</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Final policy recommendations to address financial stability risks created by NBFI leverage</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/leverage-in-nonbank-financial-intermediation-final-report/">recommendations on NBFI leverage</a>, which have been delivered to the G20, set out an integrated approach for addressing financial stability risks created by NBFI leverage. Under this approach, authorities should identify such risks and have appropriate policy measures in place to address the risks they identify. The recommendations provide authorities with flexibility to tailor their policy responses to their jurisdiction-specific circumstances. This includes selecting, designing, and calibrating policy measures &ndash; or combinations of measures &ndash; that address financial stability risks, while considering potential adverse effects. Authorities will share their policy responses, for example, through FSB supervisory discussions.</p>
<p>The recommendations are directed at FSB member authorities and focus on markets, entities, and activities where NBFI leverage poses financial stability risks. These risks vary across jurisdictions. The FSB and standard-setting bodies (SSBs) will undertake further work to support and assist authorities in applying the recommendations. This work will begin with supervisory discussions among authorities and, later this year, members will consider whether to pursue follow-up work on certain recommendations, including defining the potential scope of that work.</p>
<p>The recommendations reflect feedback from a public consultation. In particular, the FSB acknowledges the high degree of heterogeneity of nonbanks; that leverage in some NBFI segments is relatively limited and is not likely to pose financial stability risks; the differences between banks and various types of nonbanks, which have motivated different regulatory approaches; and that certain leveraged activities by nonbanks can facilitate hedging, enhance efficiency and support liquidity in financial markets.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Annual NBFI progress report</h3>
<p>The&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link processed-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/enhancing-the-resilience-of-nonbank-financial-intermediation-progress-report/">2025 NBFI Progress Report</a>&nbsp;notes that the work carried out to date largely completes the original policy elements of the FSB&rsquo;s NBFI work programme, which were agreed upon in response to the March 2020 market turmoil. The FSB&rsquo;s work will now shift from policymaking to&nbsp;assessing vulnerabilities, addressing data challenges, sharing members&rsquo; policy insights, and evaluating the implementation and impact of reforms.</p>
<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Workplan to address nonbank data challenges</h3>
<p>In carrying out the NBFI work programme, the FSB identified several data challenges that hinder authorities&rsquo; ability to effectively assess vulnerabilities in the nonbank sectors. To address this, the FSB has established the Nonbank Data Task Force (NDTF), chaired by the FSB Chair, Andrew Bailey. The NDTF has three objectives:</p>

<p>As part of this work, the FSB has launched a test case on leveraged trading strategies in sovereign bond markets to assess how much progress can be made in addressing key nonbank data challenges. This area was chosen due to its critical importance to financial stability and the key data challenges it presents, including some with a significant cross-border dimension.</p>
<p>At the request of the South African G20 Presidency, the FSB is submitting a&nbsp;<a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2025/07/fsb-workplan-to-address-nonbank-data-challenges/">workplan to address nonbank data challenges</a>, which outlines how the NDTF&rsquo;s work will be structured and the next steps. The FSB will publish a report on the NDTF test case by mid-2026, detailing ways to address the identified data challenges. Following this, the FSB will determine whether further work should be undertaken in other areas.</p>
<p>In parallel, the FSB has also decided to conduct an analytical deep dive on vulnerabilities in private credit, which will include the identification of data challenges in this area.</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Background</h2>
<p>The FSB published in November 2020 a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/"><em>&nbsp;</em></a><em><a class="custom-internal-link" href="https://www.fsb.org/2020/11/holistic-review-of-the-march-market-turmoil/">Holistic Review of the March Market Turmoil</a></em>, which laid out a comprehensive and ambitious work programme for strengthening the resilience of the NBFI sector while preserving its benefits.

<title>The EBA Consults To Amend Its Technical Standards On Own Funds And Eligible Liabilities</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-to-amend-its-technical-standards-on-own-funds-and-eligible-liab-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-to-amend-its-technical-standards-on-own-funds-and-eligible-liab-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation to amend the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A02014R0241-20230509&amp;qid=1752062699808"><span>EU Delegated Regulation on own funds and eligible liabilities</span></a><span>. The proposed key amendment is the shortening of the timeframe to process the applications to reduce own funds and eligible liabilities instruments under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), with the aim of simplifying processes. The consultation runs until 9 October 2025</span>.</p>
<p>Leveraging on the experience that competent and resolution authorities have gained during the past few years, and to allow institutions more flexibility in their capital planning, the EBA is proposing to shorten the timeframe to process the applications to reduce own funds and eligible liabilities instruments from four to three months.&nbsp;The initiative is in line with the EBA&rsquo;s commitment in 2021 to monitor how the submission and assessment of applications is implemented in practice. In addition, the simplified procedure for the reduction of MREL eligible liabilities for liquidation entities is removed from the RTS, in line with recent amendments of the Level 1 text.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Responses to the consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "Submit response" button on the consultation page.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published after the consultation closes, unless requested otherwise. The deadline for the submission of comments is 9 October 2025.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-consultation-paper-amending-rts-timing-application-prior-permission-reduce-own-funds" title="Public hearing on the Consultation Paper on amending RTS on the timing for the application for prior permission to reduce own funds and eligible liabilities instruments">public hearing</a>&nbsp;on this consultation will take place via conference call on 2 September 2025 from 9:00 to 10:00 CEST. Deadline for registration is 28 August 2025 at 16:00 CEST.</p>
<h4>Legal basis and background</h4>
<p>The 2021 update of the RTS on own funds and eligible liabilities instruments, among other changes, extended the timeframe to reduce own funds and eligible liabilities instruments from three to four months. The extension was necessary to cater for the more complex assessment that competent and resolution authorities needed to undertake.</p>
<p>The industry considered the four-month timeline too long in 2021 and the EBA committed to monitoring the implementation. As a result of the monitoring, in 2024, the EBA considered that competent and resolution authorities had gained the necessary experience and were able to process applications within a shorter period.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Grexel And EEX Exploring Feasibility Of Granular Guarantees Of Origin</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/grexel-and-eex-exploring-feasibility-of-granular-guarantees-of-origin-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/grexel-and-eex-exploring-feasibility-of-granular-guarantees-of-origin-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Grexel, part of EEX Group, collaborates with Granular Energy, to conduct a pilot project to assess thefeasibility and potential mechanism of granular Guarantees of Origin (GOs). In particular, the project will lookat the possibility of allowing the issuance of hourly certificates, in comparison to the current market standard of monthly GO issuance.</p>
<p>The pilot is already underway and taking place on the Irish Power market, in collaboration with selected utilities and Granular Energy, a software provider that specialises in clean energy management solutions.</p>
<p>The pilot is part of a larger project, where Grexel has been selected following a Request for Proposals process for the&nbsp;<a href="https://go.leveltenenergy.com/registry-acceleration-fund" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Registry Acceleration Fund</a>, an initiative by LevelTen Energy with support and funding from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.leveltenenergy.com/alliance" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Granular Certificate Trading Alliance</a>. In this project, Grexel will develop the capability of its platform G-REX to handle granular certificates as well as align with the Energy Tag standard. &ldquo;<em>We&rsquo;re excited to take part in this pilot project</em>,&rdquo; says Markus Klimscheffskij, CEO of Grexel. &ldquo;<em>Granularity has been discussed in the market for some time now and it&rsquo;s important for us as registry provider to understand how it can evolve further.</em></p>
<p>Aude Filippi, EEX Director Business Development Gas and Sustainability markets, comments: &ldquo;Granularity is an aspect to consider for the future development of registry services, and this pilot allows us to examine the feasibility and potential of such an approach at the early stages. While this is an exciting first step, we still have a long way to go.</p>
<p><em>We're glad to see strong market interest, with some of the largest Irish energy suppliers taking part in this pilot,</em>&rdquo; says Bruno Menu, Granular Energy cofounder and COO. &ldquo;<em>This pilot gave us the opportunity to test&nbsp;</em><em>Grexel&rsquo;s approach of introducing optional hourly GOs alongside monthly ones within their G-REX platform.</em> In the context of GOs, granularity refers to the level of detail and timely precision in tracking and certifying energy attributes, most commonly at an hourly level. This concept affects how GOs are issued, traded, and redeemed, influencing transparency and market efficiency.</p>
<p>Grexel provides the IT services for the Irish GO registry to SEMO, the Irish Energy Market Operator.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.eex.com/en/" target="_blank">European Energy Exchange (EEX)</a></span>&nbsp;is a leading energy exchange which builds secure, successful and sustainable commodity markets worldwide &ndash; together with its customers and partners. As part of EEX Group, it serves international power, natural gas, environmental, freight and agricultural markets, and provides data, reporting and registry services. EEX is an enabler of the energy transition and decarbonisation, advancing renewables integration through dedicated products and services, including those related to guarantees of origin.</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.grexel.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Grexel</a></span>&nbsp;is the leading provider of energy certificates in Europe, headquartered in Helsinki and with an annual transaction volume of over one billion MWh. Its registries are used by more than ten thousand active account holders. As part of EEX Group, Grexel offers platforms for Guarantee of Origin registries in 23 countries, including power, biomethane, heat/cold, and hydrogen.&nbsp;</p>

<title>The Monetary Agenda At The ECB - Remarks By Philip R. Lane, Member Of The Executive Board Of The ECB, At The House Of The Euro</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-monetary-agenda-at-the-ecb-remarks-by-philip-r-lane-member-of-the-execut-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-monetary-agenda-at-the-ecb-remarks-by-philip-r-lane-member-of-the-execut-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>My goal today in these remarks is to outline the current monetary agenda at the ECB.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.1" id="fn1">1</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;I will start with the monetary policy stance before turning to our updated monetary policy strategy. I will then briefly discuss the euro area bond market before concluding with a monetary perspective on the digital euro project.</p>
<h2>The monetary policy stance</h2>
<p>In a recent speech, I assessed that the challenge of returning inflation to the target after the 2021-2022 inflation surges can be considered to be largely complete.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.2" id="fn2">2</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;The orientation now for the monetary policy stance is to make sure that the current shocks and prospective new shocks hitting the economy do not lead to medium-term deviations of inflation from our two per cent target.</p>
<p>In terms of significant data developments in recent months, there has been a marked drop in energy prices and a substantial appreciation of the euro. These forces played an important role in the June 2025 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections. In addition, the fiscal outlook has materially changed for the coming years, with the overall fiscal deficit looking set to remain above three per cent over the projection horizon.</p>
<p>Guarding against the risk of temporary deviations from target turning into longer-term deviations was an important factor in our June decision to cut rates by 25 basis points. By supporting the pricing pressure needed to generate target-consistent inflation in the medium term, this cut helps ensure that the projected negative inflation deviation over the next eighteen months remains temporary and does not convert into a longer-term deviation of inflation from the target.</p>
<p>Currently, there is high uncertainty about the future of the international trade system. This uncertainty extends beyond the calibration of new tariff regimes and includes the possibility of a broader set of non-tariff barriers, a deeper intertwining of economic policies and security policies and possible revisions to the treatment of foreign portfolio investors and foreign direct investors.</p>
<p>Especially under current conditions of high uncertainty, it is essential to remain data dependent and take a meeting-by-meeting approach in making monetary policy decisions, with no pre-commitment to any particular future rate path. In addition to observing how activity and inflation are actually behaving, data dependence also extends to the incoming data on policy settings outside the monetary domain, since shifts in international and domestic policy regimes are highly relevant for future inflation dynamics.</p>
<h2>Our updated monetary policy strategy</h2>
<p>The emphasis on two-sided uncertainty about inflation dynamics very much reflects the analysis that underpins the recently announced update to our monetary policy strategy.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.3" id="fn3">3</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In addition to the geopolitical tensions outlined above, our updated monetary policy strategy statement also identified ongoing structural shifts related to digitalisation, artificial intelligence, demography, the threat to environmental sustainability and changes in the international financial system as suggesting that the inflation environment will remain uncertain and potentially more volatile, with larger target deviations in both directions, posing challenges for the conduct of monetary policy.</p>
<p>In terms of the implications for monetary policy, our assessment is that the symmetric two per cent medium-term inflation target &ndash; which has served us well and remains unchanged - is best protected by appropriately forceful or persistent monetary policy action in response to large, sustained deviations of inflation from the target in either direction, to avoid deviations becoming entrenched through de-anchored inflation expectations. In the event of significant disinflationary shocks, the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates needs to be taken into account. In the event of significant inflationary shocks, possible non-linearities in price and wage-setting need to be taken into account.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the medium-term orientation recognises that the appropriate monetary policy response to a deviation of inflation from the target is context-specific and depends on the origin, magnitude and persistence of the deviation. Subject to maintaining anchored inflation expectations, it also allows the Governing Council in its monetary policy decisions to cater for other considerations relevant to the pursuit of price stability.</p>
<p>The Governing Council bases its monetary policy decisions, including the evaluation of the proportionality of its decisions and potential side effects, on an integrated assessment of all relevant factors. Our updated strategy makes explicit that our monetary policy decisions incorporate not only the most likely path for inflation and the economy but also surrounding risks and uncertainty, including through the appropriate use of scenario and sensitivity analyses.</p>
<p>A systematic but context-specific approach to incorporating the surrounding risks and uncertainty can include, in addition to conducting a regular risk assessment, analysing the sensitivity of projections and policy choices to changes in the underlying technical assumptions and model parameters as well as exploring a range of alternative scenarios, especially in relation to specific risk events.</p>
<p>In the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions, ECB staff have conducted sensitivity and scenario analyses for many years.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.4" id="fn4">4</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;In recent years, some of this analysis has been published: this includes scenarios related to the pandemic, the unjustified Russian invasion of Ukraine, the conflicts in the Middle East and trade policy uncertainty. As we implement the updated monetary policy strategy, the incorporation of risks and uncertainty will be enhanced both in the internal preparation of monetary policy decisions and, where appropriate, in the communication of our decisions.</p>
<p>While our primary instrument is the setting of our policy rates, the Governing Council may also employ other instruments, as appropriate, to steer the monetary policy stance when the policy rates are close to the lower bound or to preserve the smooth functioning of monetary policy transmission. The list of &ldquo;unconventional&rdquo; instruments includes longer-term refinancing operations, asset purchases, negative interest rates and forward guidance. The incorporation of risks and uncertainty into monetary policy decisions also has implications for the use of such instruments. In particular, the choice, design and implementation of instruments will enable an agile response to new shocks and will appropriately reflect the intended aims, whether the calibration of the monetary policy stance or the protection of monetary policy transmission, subject to a comprehensive proportionality assessment.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.5" id="fn5">5</a>]</sup></span></p>
<h2>A more resilient euro area financial architecture</h2>
<p>Our updated monetary policy strategy statement also assesses that: &ldquo;A more resilient financial architecture &ndash; supported by progress on the savings and investments union, the completion of banking union and the introduction of a digital euro &ndash; would also support the effectiveness of monetary policy in this evolving environment&rdquo;.</p>
<p>It is beyond the scope of these remarks to review the full policy agenda in relation to the savings and investments union and the completion of banking union. Of course, the net gains from improving financial intermediation and financial integration depend on the scale of progress in implementing the pro-growth economic reform agenda, as laid out in the Draghi and Letta report. The European Commission&rsquo;s Competitiveness Compass provides a concrete roadmap for action, and its proposals, including on simplification, should be swiftly adopted.</p>
<p>Let me pick up on an important dimension of improving the euro area financial architecture by briefly discussing the potential value of an expanded pool of euro-denominated safe assets in making the euro area capital market more attractive for both European and global investors.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.6" id="fn6">6</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>The bund is the highest-rated large-country national bond in the euro area. However, the stock of bunds is too small relative to the size of the euro area or the global financial system. Especially in the context of much smaller and less volatile spreads, other national bonds also directionally contribute to the stock of safe assets. While the residual potential volatility in spreads and the lower liquidity of these bonds ultimately put a ceiling on their contribution to the supply of safe assetsupply, the overall attractiveness of the euro area bond market ultimately depends on each member state ensuring fiscal sustainability, including through the shared commitment to implement the European fiscal framework in a rigorous manner.</p>
<p>In principle, common bonds backed by the combined fiscal capacity of the EU member states should constitute a high-grade category of safe assets. However, the current stock of such bonds is simply too small to foster the necessary liquidity and risk management services (e.g. derivative markets and repo markets) that are part and parcel of serving as a safe asset. Moreover, as it stands, the stock of supranational euro bonds is currently projected to shrink over time, in view of the scheduled repayment of the NGEU bonds and, over time, the retirement of ESM bonds as the ESM loans get repaid.</p>
<p>There are several ways to expand the stock of common bonds. For instance, the member countries could decide to finance investment in European public goods through more common debt. From a public finance perspective, it is natural to match European public goods with common debt in order to align the financing with the area-wide benefits of such public goods. In addition to EU-wide initiatives, there could also be scope for common issuance by sub-groups of member countries in the context of possible &ldquo;coalition of the willing&rdquo; shared investment projects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to meet the rising global demand for euro-denominated safe assets more quickly, there are a number of ways to generate a larger stock of safe assets from the current stock of national bonds.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.7" id="fn7">7</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;For instance, Olivier Blanchard and &Aacute;ngel Ubide have proposed that the &ldquo;blue bond/red bond&rdquo; scheme (which was originally floated in 2010) be re-examined.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.8" id="fn8">8</a>]</sup></span></p>
<p>Under the Blanchard-Ubide proposal, each member country would ringfence a dedicated revenue stream (for example, a certain amount of indirect tax revenues) that could be used to service commonly issued bonds. In turn, the proceeds of issuing common bonds (blue bonds) would be deployed to purchase a given amount of the national bonds (red bonds) of each participating Member State. This mechanism would result in a larger stock of blue bonds and a lower stock of red bonds. While this type of financial reform was originally proposed during the euro area sovereign debt crisis, the conditions today are far more favourable, especially if the scale of blue bond issuance were to be calibrated in a prudent manner in order to mitigate some of the identified concerns.</p>
<p>In particular, the Blanchard-Ubide proposal gives the example of a stock of blue bonds corresponding to 25 per cent of GDP. Just to illustrate the scale of the required fiscal resources to back this level of issuance: if bond yields were in the range of 2 to 4 per cent on average, the servicing of blue bond debt would require ringfenced tax revenues in the range of 0.5 to 1 per cent of GDP. While this would constitute a significant shift in the current allocation of tax revenues between national and EU levels, it would still leave tax revenues predominantly at the national level (the ratio of tax revenues to GDP in the euro area ranges from around 20 to 40 per cent). The shared payoff would be the reduction in debt servicing costs generated by the safe asset services provided by an expanded stock of common debt.</p>
<p>An alternative and possibly complementary approach that could also deliver a larger stock of safe assets from the pool of national bonds is provided by the sovereign bond-backed securities (SBBS) proposal. This proposal envisages that financial intermediaries (whether public or private) could bundle a portfolio of national bonds and issue tranched securities, with the senior slice constituting a highly safe asset. The SBBS proposal has been studied extensively (I chaired an ESRB report on it) and draft enabling legislation has been prepared by the European Commission.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.9" id="fn9">9</a>]</sup></span><sup></sup>Just as with the blue bond/red bond proposal, sufficient issuance scale would be required in order to foster the market liquidity needed for the senior bonds to act as highly liquid safe assets.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to the digital euro, our updated monetary policy strategy statement also states that introducing a digital euro would support the effectiveness of monetary policy. In particular, as I describedoutlined in a recent speech how , a digital euro could help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area by ensuring a direct retail role for central bank digital currency can help maintain the monetary autonomy of the euro area.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.10" id="fn10">10</a>]</sup></span>&nbsp;By supplementing physical cash with digital cash, this would improve resilience by modernising the traditional two-tier monetary system whereby both cash and bank deposits can be used as a medium of exchange. This modernised system would best protect the euro&rsquo;s capacity to serve as the medium of exchange and unit of account.<span class="ecb-footnote-toggle"><sup>[<a class="ecb-footnote-number" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu//press/key/date/2025/html/ecb.sp250709~7ce2ac26a7.en.html#footnote.11" id="fn11">11</a>]</sup></span><sup></sup></p>
<p>According to some advocates, an alternative approach to adapting the monetary system to a digital age would be to promote stablecoins, issued and operated by private sector intermediaries. There may be some potentially valid use cases for stablecoins, especially in relation to improving the efficiency of cross-border payments, at least compared to the incumbent global payments infrastructure. However, stablecoins lack key attributes of central bank money. Among other limitations, as highlighted in the recent Annual Economic Report, by the Bank for International Settlements, the supply of stablecoins is not elastic (unlike central bank money) since their issuance is driven by upfront purchases by customers. In contrast, central bank money can be issued elastically (especially during a crisis) by lending to counterparties or through open market operations. Additionally, one-to-one parity between the value of a stablecoin and the value of a currency cannot be guaranteed under all circumstances, such that stablecoins do not protect the singleness of money.</p>
<p>An effective medium of exchange requires that the monetary system and the payments system form a symbiotic ecosystem. Currently, the euro area payments system is highly fragmented along national lines and many customers are dependent on non-European card or e-wallet providers to make payments across the euro area. By mandating acceptance of the digital euro, instant network effects would help to unify the currently-fragmented market, reducing costs for merchants and indirectly also for households. Such an area-wide fast payment system is unlikely to develop in the absence of the area-wide payment rails provided by the digital euro infrastructure.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the digital euro is a high priority project for the Eurosystem, subject to the enabling legislation being adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>EEX Group reports significant trading volume growth in the first half of 2025 across its major asset classes, reaching the highest ever first half-yearly volumes on the EEX power and gas derivatives, as well as the gas spot markets.</p>
<p>Over the first six months of the year the Group&rsquo;s global power markets have seen a 16% increase year-on-year, reaching close to 7,000 TWh; while volumes on the natural gas markets showed a strong 26% growth compared to the previous year&rsquo;s first half, with a total of 4,564.2 TWh.&nbsp;Highlights from the other EEX Group markets include the 25% year-on-year volume expansion on the global freight markets, as well as the 49% growth at trading in North American environmental contracts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peter Reitz, CEO of EEX, comments: &ldquo;<em>2025 so far has seen further strong growth in terms of volumes on our global power and natural gas markets, continuing the trend of the previous years. It&rsquo;s promising to see such strong trading levels on our markets and we are confident that this can continue until the end of the year and beyond.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Strong growth across power markets</span></p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>EEX Group Global Power market</span>&nbsp;volume (6,998.5 TWh) comprises significant increases on both the spot and derivatives markets in the first half of the year.&nbsp;<span>European Power Spot</span>&nbsp;trading reached 456.4 TWh (+7% YoY), while the&nbsp;<span>European Power Derivatives&nbsp;</span>markets registered a strong growth, resulting in the record level of 4,855.9 TWh (+23% YoY).</p>
<p>At a six-months level, the European markets with the biggest volume expansion year-on-year included the Hungarian (45%) and other CSEE (87%) power derivatives markets, in addition to Belgian power futures (51%).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June alone, the Belgian market also showed a significant growth at monthly volumes with a 151% increase year-on-year, followed by the Spanish power futures market volume growth of 91%. In addition, the French power derivatives market reported a record monthly traded volume with 145.2 TWh in the last month of the first half year.</p>
<p>Overall trading volumes on the&nbsp;<span>EEX Japanese Power Derivatives</span>&nbsp;market continued the triple-digit growth and the total traded volume over the first half year of 2025 (73.6 TWh) surpassed that of the full year of 2024 (72.9 TWh). This top volume derives both from futures and options trading, which latter was only introduced in February this year. As a significant next step for the development of this market, EEX launched order book trading in April, driving further trading activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Natural gas markets on a growth path</span></p>
<p>Natural gas trading at EEX Group has increased significantly both on a monthly basis in June as well as on a six-months level.</p>
<p>Over the first half of the year, the total global gas market growth included increased volumes both on the&nbsp;<span>EEX European Natural Gas Spot&nbsp;</span>(1,783.6 TWh, 24% YoY) and&nbsp;<span>Derivatives&nbsp;</span>(2,606.9 TWh, 26% YoY)<span>&nbsp;</span>markets, in addition to a 56% growth on the&nbsp;<span>North American Natural Gas&nbsp;</span>market. The most significant growth in this timeframe was seen on the Spanish PVB spot market (116%) and the Belgian ZTP derivatives market (92%).</p>
<p>In the month of June, the&nbsp;<span>EEX Global Natural Gas</span>&nbsp;markets reported a record traded volume of 914.1 TWh, driven by individual record levels on both the German THE (166% YoY) and Dutch TTF (66%) derivatives markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Positive developments on further EEX Group markets</span></p>
<p>In H1 2025, the&nbsp;<span>North American environmental markets</span>, run by Nodal Exchange, have also experienced a significant increase in terms of volumes year-on-year, with an overall 49% growth across futures and options. Trading in these options was especially noteworthy in June (+1,153%), when comparing to the previous year&rsquo;s same month.</p>
<p>In addition, during the first half year, a volume of 11.0 TWh was traded in&nbsp;<span>GO Futures,</span>&nbsp;surpassing&nbsp;<span>15 TWh&nbsp;</span>since launch.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<span>EEX Global Freight markets</span>&nbsp;also registered an overall 25% year-on-year growth, including a significant 44% monthly total trading volume growth seen in June 2025 alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full overview of EEX Group volumes for the&nbsp;<span>first half year of 2025</span>&nbsp;as well as<span>&nbsp;the June monthly volumes&nbsp;</span>in English and German&nbsp;are available in the documents below.</p>

<p><span>The Bank of England Financial Policy Committee (FPC) meets to identify risks to financial stability and agree policy actions aimed at safeguarding the resilience of the UK financial system.</span></p>
<div class="section-heading">
<h2 id="chapter-0">Record of the Financial Policy Committee meeting on 27 June 2025</h2>
<div class="box-highlight">
<h3><a id="_Hlk193965425"></a>Headline judgements and policy actions</h3>
<ul>
<li><span>Risks and uncertainty associated with geopolitical tensions, global fragmentation of trade and financial markets, and pressures on sovereign debt markets are still elevated. Some geopolitical risks have crystalised. Related to this, material uncertainty around the global macroeconomic outlook persists. As an open economy with a large financial sector, these risks are particularly relevant to UK financial stability.</span></li>
<li><span>In early April, US announcements on trade policy and subsequent responses from other jurisdictions were followed by sharp falls in valuations across many financial asset classes, including advanced economy government bonds. The US dollar also weakened.</span></li>
<li><span>Conditions in core government bond and repo markets were deteriorating but remained orderly and could have worsened absent the US announcement of a tariff pause. Overall, operational resilience was sustained during a period of high volatility and transaction volumes.</span></li>
<li><span>In some markets, risk sentiment recovered after the pause in the implementation of higher trade tariffs on 09 April. But 30-year government bond prices and the US dollar remain at or near multi-year lows, and correlations with risky asset prices have shifted from historical norms. Overall, term premia globally have increased materially and remain elevated. Risky asset valuations, which had been stretched prior to April, have subsequently returned to previous levels, despite the high level of uncertainty that persists. Therefore, the risk of sharp falls in risky asset prices, abrupt shifts in asset allocation and a more prolonged breakdown in historical correlations remains high. Any vulnerabilities in market-based finance could amplify such moves, potentially affecting the availability and cost of credit in the UK. It is important that in their risk management, market participants are prepared for such shocks.</span></li>
<li><span>In the UK, household and corporate borrowers remain resilient in aggregate. The UK banking system remains in a strong position to support households and businesses, even if economic, financial and business conditions became substantially worse than expected.</span></li>
<li><span>Considered over a longer time horizon, UK bank capital levels in aggregate have been broadly stable since the completion of the phase-in of the post-global financial crisis (GFC) bank capital framework in 2019. While the FPC judge the level of capital in the banking system to be broadly appropriate, it has been five years since the Committee&rsquo;s last assessment of the overall level of capital requirements. Therefore, it will refresh that assessment and provide an update on this work in the next Financial Stability Report (FSR).</span></li>
<li><span>The FPC has maintained the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate at 2%.</span>&nbsp;The Committee noted the greater likelihood of severe global shocks, which continued to pose a threat to UK financial conditions and recognised that some global risks had crystalised since Q1. However, risk indicators most directly relevant to banks' UK exposures, to which the UK CCyB rate was applied, were not materially above long-term averages.</li>
<li><span>The FPC discussed risks from NBFI leverage to financial stability via core financial markets and systemically important institutions as well as ongoing policy initiatives to address these.</span>&nbsp;The Committee welcomed progress in developing monitoring tools, including more comprehensive data on systemic institutions&rsquo; exposures to NBFIs and for NBFI leverage in core markets. It agreed to publish aggregated information on leverage and positioning to support market participants in understanding their positioning relative to the market, thereby informing their internal risk management.</li>
<li><span>The Committee discussed the significant developments in stablecoins, globally, since the November 2024 FSR and discussed Bank and Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) policy proposals for the regulatory regime for systemic and non-systemic stablecoins.</span>&nbsp;It noted the financial stability benefits of having a regulatory framework that is proportionate to risks, allows for some degree of alignment with other jurisdictions and supports firms setting up in the UK. The FPC also noted that these are global markets, and it is important for the international regulatory community to consider how best to consider the financial stability risks associated with global stablecoins.</li>
<li><span>The FPC considered the findings of the 2024 Cyber Stress Test (CST24)</span>&nbsp;and noted that cyber and operational resilience stress testing remain a core part of the Committee&rsquo;s toolkit for understanding firms&rsquo; ability to respond and recover from severe but plausible operational disruption. It welcomed the findings published in the CST24 thematic letter of 9 July, which aim to assist firms in understanding how operational disruption of their services could lead, through financial, operational and confidence channels, to broader potential financial stability impacts. The Committee judged this important in assisting all firms to improve their understanding and analysis of such financial stability impacts, consistent with expectations for firms&rsquo; management of their operational resilience.</li>
<li><span>The FPC discussed the current operation of its loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit, building on its deliberations in Q1. This included whether there were any impediments to using the LTI flow limit more fully for those lenders that wished to, consistent with lenders' own risk limits and business models. The FPC recommended the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the FCA amend implementation of its LTI flow limit to allow individual lenders to increase their share of lending at high LTIs while aiming to ensure the aggregate flow remained consistent with the limit of 15%.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>1: The Financial Policy Committee (FPC) seeks to ensure the UK financial system is prepared for, and resilient to, the wide range of risks it could face, so that it is able to absorb rather than amplify shocks, and serve UK households and businesses, thus supporting stability and long-term growth in the UK economy.</p>
<p>2: The Committee met on 27 June 2025 to agree its view on the outlook for UK financial stability. The FPC discussed the risks faced by the UK financial system and assessed the resilience of the system to those risks. On that basis, the Committee agreed its intended policy actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-0">The overall risk environment</h3>
<p>3: The FPC discussed recent developments in financial markets; global vulnerabilities; UK household and corporate debt vulnerabilities; and the resilience of the UK banking sector and market-based finance. The FPC&rsquo;s judgements for these areas would be set out in the July&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/july-2025">Financial Stability Report</a>&nbsp;(FSR).</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-1">The UK countercyclical capital buffer rate and UK bank capital</h3>
<p>4: The FPC discussed its setting of the UK countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate. The Committee&rsquo;s principal aim in setting the CCyB rate was to help ensure that the UK banking system was better able to absorb shocks without an unwarranted restriction in essential services, such as the supply of credit, to the UK real economy. Setting the UK CCyB rate enabled the FPC to adjust the capital requirements of the UK banking system to the changing scale of risk of losses on banks&rsquo; UK exposures over the course of the financial cycle. The approach therefore included an assessment of financial vulnerabilities and banks' capacity to absorb such losses, including the potential impact of shocks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>5: In considering the appropriate setting of the UK CCyB rate, the FPC discussed its judgements around underlying vulnerabilities that could amplify economic shocks. The elevated likelihood of severe global shocks, including those related to geopolitics and changes in global trade arrangements, continued to pose a material threat to UK financial conditions. In addition, some global risks had crystalised since Q1 and vulnerabilities in market-based finance, including in core markets, remained material. The Committee noted the importance of ongoing policy initiatives that would more directly address these vulnerabilities than the CCyB, such as exploring ways to improve gilt repo market resilience, supporting the Bank in building its toolkit to support the functioning of the repo market in systemwide stress via the Contingent NBFI Repo Facility, and supporting international work to address NBFI leverage.</p>
<p>6: Indicators most directly relevant to the risk of banks' UK exposures, to which the UK CCyB rate was applied, such as domestic credit growth and indicators of debt vulnerabilities, were not materially above long-term averages. The UK banking system was well capitalised, and its resilience continued to be supported by relatively strong asset quality, and the Committee noted that the results of last year&rsquo;s desk-based stress test suggested that the UK banking system could continue to support households and businesses even if economic, financial and business conditions turned out to be substantially worse than expected.</p>
<p>7: Overall, the FPC judged that credit conditions had not significantly added to vulnerabilities that might amplify shocks. Some indicators pointed to an easing in credit conditions in the mortgage market in the first quarter of the year. Credit conditions were also reported to have eased a little for smaller businesses, though demand for corporate credit more broadly remained subdued. Banks were not restricting lending to protect their capital positions. The Committee would continue to monitor the evolution of financial conditions closely, as well as reviewing the results of the 2025 Bank Capital Stress Test, to ensure the setting of the CCyB remained appropriate.</p>
<p>8: In view of these considerations, the FPC decided to maintain the UK CCyB rate at 2%.</p>
<p>9: The FPC sets the UK CCyB rate in line with the evolution of economic and financial conditions, underlying vulnerabilities, and the overall risk environment. The Committee noted the continuing high levels of uncertainty and that the global risk environment had deteriorated in recent quarters. The Committee stood ready to cut the UK CCyB rate should risks to UK economic and financial conditions appear to be materialising such that the banking system was likely to restrict lending by more than was warranted by the macroeconomic environment.</p>
<p>10: The FPC also stood ready to increase the UK CCyB rate. UK households and corporates had remained resilient, but if credit conditions loosened in a way that was not consistent with the macroeconomic outlook and vulnerabilities that could amplify future economic shocks increased to an elevated level, or if a higher risk of losses on UK exposures could impact the future resilience of the UK banking system, the FPC would be prepared to raise the UK CCyB rate above 2%, consistent with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/paper/2023/the-financial-policy-committees-approach-to-setting-the-countercyclical-capital-buffer.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">CCyB Policy Statement<span class="visually-hidden">Opens in a new window</span><span class="icon-external">&nbsp;</span></a>. This would help ensure that banks had an additional cushion of capital with which to absorb potential losses, enhancing their resilience and ability to continue lending to the real economy through a future economic shock.</p>
<p>11: In addition, the Committee noted that considered over a longer time horizon, capital levels in aggregate had been broadly stable since the completion of the phase-in of the post-global financial crisis (GFC) bank capital framework in 2019. While the FPC judged the level of capital in the banking system to be broadly appropriate, it noted that it had been five years since the Committee&rsquo;s last assessment of the overall level of capital requirements. Therefore, it would refresh that assessment and provide an update on this work in its next FSR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-2">NBFI leverage</h3>
<p>12: The FPC discussed risks to UK financial stability from NBFI leverage as well as on-going policy initiatives to address them. Financial stability risks arise in core financial markets where leveraged non-banks such as hedge funds and liability-driven investment (LDI) funds are active, and via links to systemically important institutions such as banks and central counterparties (CCPs).</p>
<p>13: The Committee noted the continued growth of leveraged strategies in the gilt market since early 2024. The FPC observed that the disorderly unwind of these strategies could be driven by several common triggers, including the sudden withdrawal of funding in the gilt repo market, sharp increases in margin or collateral calls, stop loss or risk limit breaches, as well as cross-market or cross-border contagion due to the interconnected nature of financial markets and the presence of common participants. In particular, positions with directional exposures could result in one-way sales of gilts when unwound which could challenge market functioning. In addition, relative value strategies that used net repo borrowing to arbitrage between different related financial instruments (such as the cash-futures basis trade) could also threaten financial stability, for example if intermediation capacity were impaired or if correlations between instruments were to break down, as had occurred during the March 2020 &lsquo;dash for cash.&rsquo;</p>
<p>14: While UK core market functioning was resilient during the period of high volatility in April, the relatively short-lived nature of the market disruption helped limit its impact. The FPC observed that LDI buffers remained stable and above regulatory guidance in the resilience standard, despite rising interest rates in the gilt market, allowing the sector to absorb rather than amplify stress.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>15: The Committee noted that leveraged positioning could change quickly, and as the footprint of NBFIs in core markets continued to grow the mix of strategies may change. Therefore, continued monitoring was critical and the FPC would publish aggregated information on leverage and positioning to support market participants in understanding their positioning relative to the market, thereby informing their internal risk management.&nbsp;It also noted the importance of continuing to refine the Bank&rsquo;s surveillance capabilities in this space, particularly with regard to measures of concentration and crowded positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>16: In line with the increasing role of NBFIs in core markets, the FPC noted that the exposure of UK banks to NBFIs would continue to grow as banks facilitated NBFI leverage, including through repo, derivatives, and prime brokerage. The Committee discussed how continued growth in exposures to highly leveraged entities would add to banks&rsquo; counterparty credit risk, and collateralisation might not be a guarantee to avoid large default losses in stressed market conditions. The FPC noted it was important that both banks and leveraged market participants consider the impact of potential correlation breakdowns on their risk management practices.</p>
<p>17: As well as the direct impact on bank balance sheets, losses on NBFI exposures or a broad based unwind of leveraged positions by NBFIs could affect banks&rsquo; appetite to warehouse market risk and so reduce their ability to act as shock absorbers in the event of a stress.<a id="_Hlk202531087"></a> In this context, the FPC discussed recent and ongoing work to address financial stability risks from NBFI leverage to core financial markets and systemically important institutions.&nbsp;<a id="_Hlk202531077"></a>This included progress in developing surveillance and monitoring tools, including more comprehensive data on systemic institutions&rsquo; exposures to NBFIs and sterling derivatives positions of non-UK market participants to enable systematic monitoring of NBFI leverage. To help enhance resilience in gilt repo markets the Bank planned to engage with industry through an upcoming Discussion Paper, which would explore possible ways to enhance gilt repo market resilience and improve market functioning.</p>
<p>18: The FPC welcomed the Financial Stability Board (FSB)&rsquo;s policy recommendations on NBFI leverage, and noted it was important that authorities take forward work to implement them. The FPC reiterated the need for enhanced surveillance of leverage risks and international collaboration to address cross-border issues and stressed the continued importance of engagement via the work of the FSB.</p>
<p>19: Further details on NBFI leverage would be published in the July&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/july-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-3">Developments in stablecoin markets</h3>
<p><a id="_Hlk194308082"></a>Financial stability risks from stablecoins</p>
<p>20: The FPC (along with the Financial Market Infrastructure Committee) was briefed on significant developments in the stablecoin industry in the context of recent growth in the sector, evolving use cases and emerging UK and international regulatory regimes. Stablecoins were currently mainly used for cryptoasset transactions, and the main risk of this activity stemmed from potential spillovers to systemic markets, given their backing assets, which the FPC judged to be relatively limited at present. Looking ahead, the FPC noted that there could be innovation benefits associated with greater use in cross border and retail payments. However, if there were to be widespread adoption of stablecoins in the future as a means of payment, there could be important implications for risks associated with trust in money and payments services and credit provision to households and corporates, in addition to potential spillover to systemic markets.</p>
<p>21: Given the uncertainty around future usage and the international nature of these markets, the FPC noted the importance of building a regime fit for future use cases as well as current ones. The FPC also noted the importance of coordination of policymaking on an international level, to ensure that the FS risks of global stablecoins were managed.</p>
<p>Regulatory regime for systemic stablecoins</p>
<p>22: The FPC discussed the policy proposals for the regulatory regime for stablecoins in the UK in the context of developments in the stablecoins industry, the regulatory landscape internationally and the feedback provided to the 2023&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/paper/2023/dp/regulatory-regime-for-systemic-payment-systems-using-stablecoins-and-related-service-providers">Discussion Paper</a>&nbsp;on the Bank&rsquo;s regime. Guided by the FPC expectations as set out previously<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-1" id="footnote-ref-1"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;with the aim to ensure the regulatory framework facilitates payments innovation in the UK, the FPC supported staff&rsquo;s proposal to explore options for allowing some return on backing assets for these stablecoins.</p>
<p>23: The FPC noted the financial stability benefits of having a regulatory framework that is proportionate to risks, allows for some degree of alignment with other jurisdictions and supports firms setting up in the UK. The Committee further noted that the Bank&rsquo;s regime had been designed for systemic payments coins, i.e. a future use case for coins that were widely used for everyday retail transactions in the UK, while the Financial Conduct Authority&rsquo;s (FCA) proposed regime had been designed for all other non-systemic use cases. As the FPC noted previously, a systemic stablecoin that underpins a material part of the payments in the economy would need to be subject to stricter requirements (e.g. backing assets, limits as the market adjusts to new forms of digital money) than was needed in the FCA proposed regime to ensure financial stability risks are mitigated. It would need to be close to existing forms of money and interoperable with them in order to maintain trust in the currency &ndash; thereby adhering to the principles of singleness of and trust in money. The FPC noted that the Bank would continue to work with the FCA to manage the transition for firms moving from the FCA to Bank&rsquo;s proposed regime.</p>
<p>24: With respect to wholesale financial market transactions, as previously noted, the FPC had a low-risk appetite for a significant shift away from central bank money as the primary settlement asset in the financial system. The FPC was briefed on the potential use of sandboxes to allow industry to experiment with stablecoins used for wholesale transactions. This would allow the Bank to understand more about the potential risks around settlement in stablecoins in wholesale markets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-4">Cyber stress testing</h3>
<p>25: The FPC welcomed the findings of the 2024 Cyber Stress Test (CST24), including the thematic findings published in the CST24&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/prudential-regulation/letter/2024/thematic-findings-2024-cyber-stress-test">thematic letter</a>. Cyber and operational resilience stress testing remained a core part of the Committee&rsquo;s toolkit for understanding firms&rsquo; ability to respond and recover from severe but plausible operational disruption. The FPC concluded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Firms demonstrated a range of mature resilience and mitigation capabilities that had been individually and collectively exercised and tested. Firms should continue to invest in testing, in particular where they might need to coordinate mitigating actions across the sector or might need to take action to mitigate risks to financial stability, even where firm safety and soundness is not at risk.</li>
<li>Firms should consider contingencies for scenarios affecting their ability to prioritise and process payments, which was a key mitigant for risks to financial stability in the test.</li>
<li>Another key mitigant was the ability of firms to provide liquidity to their customers when transactions were unable to settle. Understanding and preparation for the liquidity needs of customers over the potentially extended period when settlement systems were impaired, and their relative importance for maintaining financial stability, should form part of a meeting financial stability impact tolerances.</li>
<li>Firms&rsquo; decisions about disconnecting from and reconnecting to critical systems and infrastructures would determine their ability to mitigate financial stability impacts since disconnection would mean no further transactions could be processed and reconnection was typically a lengthy process. Firms should ensure their disconnection and reconnection options are understood and are aligned to their risk appetites, and that playbooks reflect the potential financial stability impacts of a loss of key connections. Financial Market Infrastructures (FMIs) should also work with the sector to ensure their members understand the nuances and implications of disconnection and reconnection and are able to make informed, risk-based decisions which reflect the financial stability implications of these decisions.</li>
<li>In the test, firms lacked maturity in their understanding and articulation of how the impacts of a disruption of their services could affect overall financial stability. Such an understanding was a critical input into firms&rsquo; determination of the appropriate tolerance for disruption to their operations. The thematic letter and related materials shared the thematic findings from the test and would assist firms in understanding how an operational disruption of their services could lead, through financial, operational, and confidence channels, to broader potential financial instability impacts. This should assist all firms in improving their understanding and analysis of financial stability and so the appropriate determination of impact tolerances.</li>
</ul>
<p>26: The FPC welcomed the FCA&rsquo;s view in the thematic letter, on how firms should think about rules for Treating Customers Fairly alongside the prioritisation of some payments to mitigate risks to financial stability. The clarification provided should help increase firms&rsquo; ability to mitigate financial stability impacts and support sector operational resilience.</p>
<p>27: The FPC welcomed the work that industry was currently progressing, including through the Cross Market Operational Resilience Group (CMORG) which would build the sector&rsquo;s understanding of how disconnection and reconnection could impact financial stability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-5">Mortgage policies</h3>
<p>28: The Committee noted its role in supporting the Government&rsquo;s priority to make home ownership more accessible and discussed the UK housing market and the role of regulatory mortgage policies. Evidence suggested that accumulating a sufficient deposit continued to be the main barrier to owning a home. The FPC&rsquo;s loan-to-income (LTI) flow limit (which limited the flow of high LTI mortgages to 15%) had limited ability to directly address this barrier, and so the Committee supported initiatives to explore increases in the supply of housing and greater access of creditworthy households to mortgages, including at higher-LTVs.</p>
<p>29: The Committee was briefed on recent and upcoming publications from the FCA related to their Mortgage Conduct of Business (MCOB) rules. These included a statement on the interest rate stress test rules published in March<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-2" id="footnote-ref-2"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[2]</a></sup>, a Consultation Paper published in May<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-3" id="footnote-ref-3"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[3]</a></sup>&nbsp;and a Discussion Paper<sup><sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-4" id="footnote-ref-4"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[4]</a></sup></sup>, published on 25 June. Lenders had already changed their behaviour in light of the first publication. Major lenders were now reporting they had, on average, reduced stress rates on lending fixed for less than five years by around 110 basis points in response to the statement.</p>
<p>30: The Committee noted that in addition to its role in consumer protection, the FCA&rsquo;s affordability assessments, including the interest rate stress, worked alongside FPC policy to mitigate risks to financial stability. The Committee judged that, despite the recent changes in lender stress rates, the combined impact of the two policies, as currently stated, continued to guard against these risks. It judged that in both a central outlook and a house price boom scenario, the share of households with a high debt-servicing ratio (DSR) would remain well below pre-GFC highs. The Committee noted that the future stock of borrowers would have lower resilience against interest rate shocks and arrears might expect to rise but these risks remained contained, in part due to the LTI flow limit.</p>
<p>31: In relation to the current operation of its LTI flow limit, the FPC was supportive of lenders making use of their individual LTI flow limits consistent with their own risk limits and business models. In support of this, the FPC considered whether there were any impediments to using those limits for those lenders that wished to. The FPC had previously simplified its housing tools by removing its affordability test and raising the threshold under which lenders would be exempt from &pound;100 million per annum to &pound;150 million.</p>
<p>32: The Committee noted that the original policy intent of the LTI flow limit recommendation was to ensure the flow of new residential mortgages at high LTIs did not exceed 15% of total new mortgages&nbsp;<em>in aggregate</em>. The FPC judged that the aggregate 15 per cent limit continued to strike the right balance between providing appropriate protection from the increased risk to economic growth of large cuts to consumption associated with an over-indebted household sector, while providing sufficient capacity for otherwise creditworthy households to borrow at higher LTIs.</p>
<p>33: The FPC considered whether there were any factors that could lead to less than full use of the aggregate limit (aside of such lending being inconsistent with lenders&rsquo; own risk limits). Staff engagement with industry found that, for example, variations in risk appetite and business models between lenders might mean that some lenders would not be likely to extend many mortgages at higher LTIs even as other lenders might be constrained by regulatory limits from doing so. Most lenders also left management buffers to the regulatory limit to ensure that they would not breach it.</p>
<p>34: In conclusion, the Committee recommended the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and the FCA amend implementation of its LTI flow limit to allow individual lenders to increase their share of lending at high LTIs while aiming to ensure the aggregate flow remained consistent with the limit of 15%. The FPC recognised that, in doing so, such high LTI lending by individual lenders could exceed 15% of their total number of new residential mortgages while the aggregate flow remained consistent with the 15% limit. Accordingly, the FPC revoked the Q4 2024 recommendation and issued a new recommendation to the PRA and FCA, as set out in Annex 1. The FPC had considered its general duties in reaching this decision.</p>
<p>35: The PRA and FCA would consult on the approach to implementing this policy in due course. Once implemented, the impact of their finalised policy framework, and its effect on the aggregate flow, would be monitored regularly by the FPC and the regulators.</p>
<p>36: Further detail on mortgage policies, including the LTI flow limit, would be published in the July&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-stability-report/2025/july-2025">FSR</a>.</p>

<div class="section-heading">
<h3 id="chapter-0-6">O-SII buffer framework</h3>
<p>37: The Other Systemically Important Institutions (O-SII) buffer is the UK&rsquo;s capital buffer for certain domestic systemically important banks. The buffer raises the capacity of these firms to withstand stress, thereby increasing their resilience relative to a smaller, non-systemic firm, consistent with international standards. The Capital Buffer Regulations (CBR)<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-5" id="footnote-ref-5"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[5]</a></sup>&nbsp;set out the scope of application of the O-SII buffer in legislation, while the FPC&rsquo;s O-SII buffer framework sets out the detail of how the framework operates to support financial stability.</p>
<p>38: On 5 June 2025, Parliament approved a restated Capital Buffers Statutory Instrument<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-6" id="footnote-ref-6"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[6]</a></sup>, which included changes to the definition of the O-SII buffer scope. These were consequential changes, resulting from amendments to the regulations for ring-fenced banks<sup><a class="footnote-link" href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/financial-policy-committee-record/2025/july-2025#footnote-7" id="footnote-ref-7"><span class="visually-hidden">footnote</span>[7]</a></sup>&nbsp;that aimed to preserve the scope of the O-SII buffer framework in line with FPC&rsquo;s policy intent of ensuring appropriate resilience of firms that are systemically important for the domestic economy. To reflect these consequential changes in the O-SII buffer framework, the FPC:</p>
<ul>
<li>updated the definition of ring-fenced banks in its policy statement in line with the updated ring-fencing regulations. Therefore, references to &lsquo;ring-fenced banks&rsquo; in the policy statement should be read as &lsquo;ring-fenced banks and large domestic banks&rsquo;.</li>
<li>similarly, references to &ldquo;large building societies&rdquo; should be read as those with more than &pound;35 billion of deposits and shares (compared to &pound;25 billion previously), to maintain its equivalence with the new primary threshold that applies for banking groups subject to ring-fencing.</li>
<li>consistent with the capital buffers SI, added a category to the definition of firms in scope of the O-SII buffer. This &ldquo;UK deposit-taker (other than a building society)&rdquo; category was defined in the capital buffers SI as a bank that exceeds &pound;35 billion in core deposits and does not have material trading activities (i.e. trading assets of less than 10% of Tier 1 capital). The purpose of this category was to ensure that large domestic banks with low levels of trading assets which are systemically important continued to be in scope of the O-SII buffer framework as had previously been the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>39: These updates would not change any firm&rsquo;s current capital requirements. The proposed changes would ensure that the scope of FPC&rsquo;s O-SII buffer framework continued to include firms that were currently systemically important, or would become so in future, for example, through mergers and acquisitions, or expansion in their balance sheets.</p>
<p>40: Also, in line with the restated CBR, the FPC updated its O-SII buffer framework policy document to reflect the increased length of the review cycle of the O-SII buffer framework from at least every two to at least every three years. This reflected a more proportionate review cycle, considering the framework had become more mature, having been in operation since 2019. The FPC may choose to update the framework more frequently, if the need arose.</p>
<p>41: The FPC updated its O-SII buffer framework policy document on 3 July 2025 to reflect these amendments to the CBR SI and provide further details explaining the update in the definition of the scope of O-SII buffer.</p>
<p>The following members of the Committee were present at the 27 June Policy meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Andrew Bailey, Governor</li>
<li>Nathana&euml;l Benjamin</li>
<li>Colette Bowe</li>
<li>Sarah Breeden</li>
<li>Jon Hall</li>
<li>Randall Kroszner</li>

<li>Liz Oakes</li>
<li>Dave Ramsden</li>
<li>Nikhil Rathi</li>
<li>Carolyn Wilkins</li>
<li>Sam Woods</li>
</ul>
<p>Gwyneth Nurse attended as the Treasury member in a non-voting capacity.</p>
<p>Given this was Colette Bowe&rsquo;s final meeting ahead of her second term ending in August 2025 the Chair, on behalf of the Committee, recorded their thanks for her service to the Financial Policy Committee.</p>
<p>In accordance with the relevant provisions of the Bank of England Act 1998:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jon Hall had notified the Committee of his shareholding at Guardtime (a blockchain based information security provider). It was agreed that he would recuse himself from discussions on cryptoassets, including stablecoins, and that he would not receive the related papers.</li>
<li>Under the same provisions, Liz Oakes had notified the Committee of her position as an independent non-executive director on the boards of ecommerce payment businesses of the private equity investor Advent International, which has a majority shareholding in Mangopay. It was agreed that she would recuse herself from discussions on payment systems and stablecoins, and that she would not receive the related papers.</li>

<title>The EBA Consults On The Revision Of Product Oversight And Governance Guidelines For Retail Banking Products To Consider Products With ESG Features And Greenwashing Risks</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-the-revision-of-product-oversight-and-governance-guidelines-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-the-revision-of-product-oversight-and-governance-guidelines-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation proposing to revise the EBA Guidelines on product oversight and governance (POG) arrangements for retail banking products. The proposed revision aims to prevent greenwashing and ensure that financial institutions meet the highest standards of business conduct when offering products with Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) features to consumers. The consultation runs until 9 October 2025.</span></p>
<p>The proposed amendments aim to strike the right balance between clarifying existing POG requirements for products with ESG features to prevent consumer detriment (e.g. risks of misleading commercial practices, mis-selling of products etc.) that might occur if financial institutions fail to comply with conduct requirements when offering product with ESG features, without imposing additional regulatory burden on FIs.</p>
<p>In June 2024, the EBA published a report on greenwashing, highlighting an increase in potential cases across all sectors, including among EU banks. In light of this report and recent legislative changes such as amendments to the Capital Requirement Directive (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) regarding ESG risks, the EBA concluded that it is necessary to give further consideration to products with ESG features and greenwashing risks in the existing POG Guidelines.</p>
<p>The consultation paper proposes a targeted approach, adjusting only a limited number of existing requirements in the POG GLs related to the subject matter, manufacturer&rsquo;s internal control functions, the target market, distribution channels, information for distributors and information and support for the manufacturer&rsquo;s arrangements.</p>
<p>The EBA expects to publish its final guidelines in Q1 2026, which will be applied as of 1 December 2026.</p>
<h4>Consultation process and next steps</h4>
<p>Comments to this consultation can be sent to the EBA by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the&nbsp;consultation page. Please note that the deadline for the submission of comments is 9 October 2025. All received contributions will be published at the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on the consultation paper on 11 September 2025 from 14:30 to 16:30 CET. Please register for the hearing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/eba-online-public-hearing-revision-guidelines-product-oversight-and-governance-arrangements-retail">here</a>&nbsp;by 8 September 2025 by 17:00 CET. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>The EBA issued its initial POG Guidelines in 2016 to address conduct failures of financial institutions. These Guidelines are addressed to manufacturers and distributors of retail banking products in EBA&rsquo;s remit, namely mortgages, personal loans, deposits, payment accounts, payment services, and electronic money. Recent legislative developments necessitate a revision to incorporate ESG objectives and greenwashing risks and to ensure compliance with the highest standards of business conduct.</p>
<p>The EBA developed these draft Guidelines in accordance with Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 which empowers the EBA to issue guidelines to ensure the effective and consistent application of European Union law.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>&euro;43.32 million raised<sup>1</sup></li>
<li>Market capitalisation of &euro;580 million</li>
<li>31<span>st</span><span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext in 2025</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Euronext today congratulates EnergyVision, a B2B and B2C provider of solar energy and mobility as a service solutions and EPC&nbsp; (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) contractor, on its listing on Euronext Brussels&nbsp;&nbsp;(ticker code: ENRGY). It is the 31<span>st</span>&nbsp;listing on Euronext markets in 2025.</p>
<p>EnergyVision is a fast-growing integrated B2B and B2C provider of solar energy and mobility as a service solutions for both corporate and residential clients in Belgium. In addition to building, owning, and operating photovoltaic (PV) and electric vehicle charging infrastructures&nbsp;steering both energy production and consumption towards a greener future, EnergyVision also builds, installs and sells solar energy systems as an Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) firm in Belgium and abroad with customers in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.&nbsp;The company plays a key role as an EPC contractor, managing the end-to-end delivery of energy projects, in Belgium, China and Morocco.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EnergyVision was listed through the admission to trading on 9 July 2025 of the 61,138,400 shares making up its equity including 4,450,000 new shares issued under a Global Offering<sup>2</sup>, before the potential exercise of the over-allotment option amounting to 110,000 new shares.</p>
<p>The admission and issue price of EnergyVision shares was set at &euro;9.50 per share. Market capitalisation was &euro;580 million on the day of listing. The Initial Public Offering (IPO) raised &euro;43.32&nbsp;million altogether<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>EnergyVision is an alumnus of IPOready, Euronext&rsquo;s pre-IPO educational programme. IPOready helps fast-growing European companies planning to list on the stock market by providing their executive teams with exclusive tools and insight from industry leaders, advisors and experts.</p>
<p><span>Maarten Michielssens, CEO of EnergyVision, said:</span>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Today marks a truly historic milestone for EnergyVision. Our mission has always been to accelerate the energy transition &mdash; not above people&rsquo;s heads, but hand in hand with them. That&rsquo;s why this IPO is so important, and why we ensured private investors could participate alongside us. We&rsquo;re building a stronger, deeper, more future-proof energy company together. It&rsquo;s also a testament to the incredible work of our teams. This IPO will undoubtedly change the shape of our company, yet at heart, we remain the same: by people, for people. We are ready for what is next. Like Belgium&rsquo;s recent IPO success stories, we&rsquo;re starting at the bottom of the price range, fully focused on long-term value creation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em><img alt="EnergyVision" src="https://mondovisione.com/_assets/images/EnergyVision.jpg" title="EnergyVision" /><br /></em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;</em><span style="font-size: 11px;">Caption:</span><span style="font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;Maarten Michielssens, CEO of EnergyVision, and his team rang the bell during a ceremony this morning to celebrate the IPO of EnergyVision.</span></p>

<title>Tel Aviv Stock Exchange - Launching A Trading At Last (TAL) Trading Phase - TASE Continues To Upgrade The Israeli Capital Market And Align It With International Standards - Launching A Trading At Last (TAL) Trading Phase</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tel-aviv-stock-exchange-launching-a-trading-at-last-tal-trading-phase-tase-202579/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/tel-aviv-stock-exchange-launching-a-trading-at-last-tal-trading-phase-tase-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>TASE is launching a new trading phase,&nbsp;<strong>Trading at Last (TAL)</strong>, which will enable the execution of trades at the security&rsquo;s closing price after the closing auction phase.</p>
<p>This initiative follows a record-breaking first half of 2025 for the capital market: the TA-35, TA-90, and TA-125 indices all hit historical highs, with a cumulative gain of 20% since January 2025, despite significant domestic and international challenges, and the TA-35 index crossed the 3,000 points mark for the first time. Additionally, the average daily trading volume in the first half of 2025 reached NIS 3 billion, an increase of 35% compared to the second half of 2024. Currently, close to NIS 305 billion is managed through tracking assets, of which NIS 167 billion tracks Israeli indices, which are expected to benefit from reduced tracking error enabled by the TAL.</p>
<p><strong>Final opportunity of the day to trade at the precise closing price</strong></p>
<p>The TAL phase will immediately follow the closing auction phase and will last 5-6 minutes. During the TAL phase, orders can be submitted&nbsp;<em>without a price</em>. These orders will be executed at the&nbsp;<strong>closing price&nbsp;</strong>determined after the closing auction, ensuring precise execution aligned with the customer&rsquo;s needs.</p>
<p>This initiative addresses a direct demand from the market, particularly from institutions, asset managers, mutual funds, and foreign investors. It also aligns Israel's trading practices with those prevalent in leading global exchanges.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing liquidity, transparency and alignment with international standards</strong></p>
<p>The launch of the TAL phase is part of a global trend to strengthen end-of-day trading activity, offering significant advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Passive Funds gain an &ldquo;effective additional opportunity&rdquo; to cover securities in line with their tracking assets and minimize tracking errors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Institutional investors can ensure accurate pricing for their portfolio without the typical volatility of an auction.</li>
<li>Foreign Investors can operate using similar methods to those common in global markets.</li>
<li>All Participants benefit from an additional time window to execute orders, even those not submitted during the closing auction phase.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The process</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The TAL phase will last 5&ndash;6 minutes from the end of the closing auction phase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Trades will be executed at the closing price set for the security.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Types of orders in the TAL phase: TAL order and TAL Ice (iceberg) order, to maintain confidentiality.</li>
</ul>
<p>Block trading (large-volume transactions) is also supported: block orders can be submitted during the TAL phase, enabling share distributions to be executed directly within the trading session, rather than as an OTC transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features of TAL Transactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The transactions will be published immediately upon execution.</li>
<li>The transactions will be included in the calculation of the trading volumes on TASE.</li>
<li>Securities, the trading in which was concluded earlier than anticipated (e.g., due to a trading suspension that is expected to terminate after the closing auction phase), will not be included in the TAL phase.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new trading phase has been approved as part of the ongoing enhancement of trading capabilities and expansion of the range of services and order types, pursuant to TASE's strategic plan of upgrading the capital market, aligning it with international standards and enhancing the liquidity and accessibility of the Israeli capital market for international investors. This comprehensive plan includes, among others, the transition to Monday-to-Friday trading, set to begin in 2026, the launch of the Block platform for executing large, coordinated, and protected transactions, which are immediately and transparently published on TASE's systems, the new market making program, featuring an increase in the number of market makers in shares, and a tailor-made market making program for public companies, with Bank Hapoalim being the first to join.</p>
<p><strong>Yaniv Pagot, EVP, Head of Trading at TASE:</strong>&nbsp;&ldquo;The launch of the TAL trading phase underscores our commitment to developing and upgrading the capital market. This new trading phase will ensure precision, accessibility, and transparency even at the end of the trading day, benefiting all participants, both local and international. We are proud to align with leading global exchanges, while also adapting to the specific needs of the local capital market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>TAL will be available commencing on August 10, 2025.</strong></p>

<title>The World Federation Of Exchanges Calls On UK To Remove VAT On Carbon Credits And Classify Them As Financial Instruments</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-world-federation-of-exchanges-calls-on-uk-to-remove-vat-on-carbon-credits-an-202579/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry association for exchanges and clearing houses, has published its response to the UK Government&rsquo;s consultation on Voluntary Carbon and Nature Markets, welcoming the ambition to raise standards and foster market integrity.<br /><br />Exchanges will play a critical role in enabling fair, transparent, and effective carbon and nature markets by providing secure infrastructure for trading, better price discovery, and greater investor protection. The WFE supports the Government&rsquo;s principles-based approach to developing these markets and efforts to align with international standards and best practice.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>The key recommendations the WFE set out in the response are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adopt a &ldquo;climate-first&rdquo; approach due to greater maturity and standardisation in the carbon credit space compared to nature credits.</li>
<li>Define legal rights for carbon and nature credits</li>
<li>Zero-rate VAT on carbon credit transactions to encourage market participation.</li>
<li>Pursue a whole-of-Government approach is to align legal, tax, accounting, and prudential systems with the goal of supporting carbon and nature markets.</li>
<li>Maintain flexibility on international standards to accommodate a rapidly evolving market landscape and allow room for innovation.</li>
<li>Require all firms in scope of the UK&rsquo;s TCFD and prospective SDR regimes to publish transition plans, incentivising companies to take responsibility for their emissions and sustainability impacts. Facilitate participation in Article 6 carbon credit mechanisms under the Paris Agreement to enhance liquidity and scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Throughout, the WFE&rsquo;s response underscores the importance of global interoperability through homogenous product specification, especially around emerging nature-related regulations and standards.<br /><br /><strong>Nandini Sukumar, CEO of the WFE</strong>, said, &ldquo;Carbon and nature markets hold enormous potential to accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy when coupled with other measures to decarbonise such as robust net zero targets and transition plans. But to succeed, they need the same legal clarity, tax neutrality and investor protections we expect from any mature financial market. To further support the development of these markets, we urge policymakers to remove VAT on carbon credits and recognise them as financial instruments.&rdquo;<br /><br />Read the full response&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://world-exchanges.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=48ddcbc11eb58f141a51219ea&amp;id=8c3f66b0af&amp;e=979576350c" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<title>Droit Adds 'Explore Mode' To Adept, Its Global Regulatory Decision-Making Platform - Droit Awarded Patent Approval For Regulatory Exploration Technology, Enabling Global Customer Base To Better Understand Obligations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Droit, a technology firm at the forefront of computational law and regulation, launches 'Explore Mode' for its Adept Platform using newly patented technology for methods and systems to identify and trace regulatory obligations associated with a set of transactions or scenarios.</p>
<p>Today, global financial Institutions rely on Droit's Adept platform to drive intelligent decision-making across pre-trade and post-trade controls; it allows users to evaluate the permissibility of transactions and comply with regulatory reporting, with full traceability for each step in the decision process.</p>
<p>Adept's new, patented 'Explore Mode' provides institutions with a new way of interacting with the rules both across Droit's pre-trade products, which enable financial institutions to understand their commercial possibilities and validate readiness to engage, as well as post-trade, for regulatory reporting.</p>
<p>Previously, Adept required complete transaction details to relay regulatory requirements and obligations or render "trade" or "do not trade" decisions. With 'Explore Mode', institutions can explore 'what if' scenarios, discover what kind of transactions are possible, and gain a complete understanding of the regulatory impact associated with various decisions, as well as other available compliant options. The new feature enables Droit's clients to input partial information and/or a desired outcome to identify possible scenarios that fit the defined set of constraints and meet all applicable rules and regulations.</p>
<p>"Explore Mode allows our clients to go beyond the input constraints of a single defined transaction, and to interrogate the full scope of permissible activities. This comprehensive insight can help unlock new potential revenue streams and expose new business opportunities,"<b>&nbsp;said Brock Arnason, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Droit.</b></p>
<p>In the post-trade space, the patented technology provides a means of efficiently applying Droit rules to large data sets with the same trusted level of transparency. When reviewing reporting obligations, firms can upload millions of transactions for bulk evaluation to quickly identify common issues and prioritize remediation efforts.</p>
<p>"This patent approval is a testament to the unique technology we've developed, enabling our clients to interact with our rules using the Adept Platform in new and expanded ways. Now, we have broadened Adept's capabilities without losing any of the transparency our clients have come to expect. Using Explore Mode, firms can solve regulatory questions at scale, quickly identify issues, or preview the impact of upcoming regulatory change,"&nbsp;<b>said</b>&nbsp;<b>Leith Dennis, Head of Adept Knowledge Engineering, Droit.</b></p>

<title>ASIC Is Seeking Feedback On Its Proposal To Remake Six Sunsetting Legislative Instruments Which Provide Disclosure Relief.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on its proposal to remake six sunsetting legislative instruments which provide disclosure relief.</p>
<p>The relief enables Australian investors to participate in offers that might not otherwise be extended to them. This is due to the time and expense involved in complying with the regulatory requirements in multiple jurisdictions where:</p>
<ul>
<li>a foreign offeror has complied with a disclosure regime offering similar levels of investor protection to the Australian disclosure requirements, or</li>
<li>very few offers are made to Australian investors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The remade legislative instruments also provide relief from the advertising restrictions for advertisements and other notices that are aimed at foreign markets and only incidentally published in Australia.</p>
<p>ASIC proposes to remake the legislative instruments on largely the same terms, for a period of five years. Some of the key changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>a consolidated exemption for authors or publishers in draft instrument&nbsp;<em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Securities&mdash;Incidental Advertising) Instrument 2025/XX</em></li>
<li>rewording the declaration in draft instrument&nbsp;<em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Small Scale Offers) Instrument 2025/XX</em>&nbsp;to remove ambiguity about when it applies and who it applies to, and</li>
<li>removing definitions which are now contained in the&nbsp;<em>Corporations Act 2001</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These changes are intended to improve clarity, not change the operation of the relief.</p>
<p>The proposed legislative instruments to be remade are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01379/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Compromises or Arrangements) Instrument 2015/358</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01377/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Rights Issues) Instrument 2015/356</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01378/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Scrip Bids) Instrument 2015/357</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01381/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Securities&mdash;Incidental Advertising) Instrument 2015/360</em></a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01380/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Securities&mdash;Publishing Notices) Instrument 2015/359</em></a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01382/latest/text"><em>ASIC Corporations (Foreign Small-Scale Offers) Instrument 2015/362</em></a>.</li>
</ul>

<title>Remarks Of Commissioner Kristin N. Johnson At George Washington University - Artificial Intelligence In Financial Markets: Enhancing Compliance, Supervision, And Enforcement</title>

<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/remarks-of-commissioner-kristin-n-johnson-at-george-washington-university-art-202578/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>Thank you to the George Washington University Regulatory Studies Center, Roger Nober, Susan Dudley, and the organizers of today&rsquo;s event for allowing me to join virtually. As many of you are aware, I have spent the last several years engaging regulators and market participants from jurisdictions around the world on issues at the core of today&rsquo;s discussion.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a></p>
<p><span>How might advances in artificial intelligence (AI) increase inclusion and customer experiences and democratize access to financial services, improve the accuracy and efficiency of financial services, and potentially reduce transaction costs as well as the costs of compliance?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These issues, among several other potential benefits and risks associated with the adoption of innovative technologies, are top of mind for me and many other senior regulators, chief executive officers, chief technology officers, chief information security officers, chief compliance officers, and chief risk managers around the world.</span></p>
<p><span>According to an International Monetary Fund paper exploring the benefits and risks of AI in finance, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies alongside other</span></p>
<p><span>[r]ecent technological advances in computing and data storage power, big data, and the digital economy are facilitating rapid AI/ML deployment in a wide range of sectors, including finance. The COVID-19 crisis has accelerated the adoption of these systems due to the increased use of digital channels.</span></p>
<p><span>AI/ML systems are changing the financial sector landscape. Competitive pressures are fueling rapid adoption of AI/ML in the financial sector by facilitating gains in efficiency and cost savings, reshaping client interfaces, enhancing forecasting accuracy, and improving risk management and compliance. AI/ML systems also offer the potential to strengthen prudential oversight and to equip [regulators]&nbsp; with new tools. . . .</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Indisputably, AI is rapidly transforming the financial sector, particularly in the areas of compliance, market surveillance, and regulatory enforcement. What once seemed the creative imaginings of science fiction or fantasy novels and films&mdash;forward-looking notions of a futuristic world&mdash;has now become a practical and increasingly essential tool across the financial market ecosystem. Market participants and regulators alike are leveraging AI and ML to improve risk management, detect misconduct, and strengthen the integrity of the markets.</span></p>
<p><span>Let&rsquo;s explore the use of AI in compliance, bad actors&rsquo; potential misuse of AI, opportunities for supervisory technology (suptech) in enforcement, and a path forward.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>AI and Industry Compliance</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Financial institutions have been at the forefront of AI adoption, especially in compliance functions. AI is widely used in anti-money laundering (AML) efforts, where algorithms analyze transaction patterns across millions of credit card statements, bank statements, and account details to detect anomalies that may go unnoticed by traditional systems. ML models have dramatically reduced false positives in AML alerts</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a><span>; this has long been a challenge for compliance teams who may now rely on AI to learn by reviewing training data and distinguish between benign and suspicious activity more precisely and more efficiently.</span></p>
<p><span>AI also supports compliance with complex cross-border financial regulations. Financial services firms deploy ML to monitor transactions for potential sanctions violations, helping ensure that transactions align with regulatory requirements based on origin, amount, frequency, and other risk factors.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"><span>[4]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Some firms have also embraced AI in communications surveillance, using platforms that offer digital communications governance to review internal communications for signs of fraud or misconduct. By automating these reviews, firms are better equipped to identify red flags early and maintain robust compliance programs.</span></p>
<p><span>A recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report released in May of 2025&mdash;</span><em><span>Artificial Intelligence: Use and Oversight in Financial Services&mdash;</span></em><span>identifies six increasingly common activities for which financial services firms may choose to integrate AI models, including automated trading, countering threats and illicit finance, credit decisions, customer service, investment decisions, and risk management.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"><span>[5]</span></a></p>
<p><span>The GAO report indicated that AI may be used to &ldquo;detect and mitigate cyber threats through real-time investigation of potential attacks, flagging and blocking of new ransomware, and identification of compromised accounts and files&rdquo; as well as to &ldquo;identify fake IDs, recognize different photos of the same person, and screen clients against sanctions and other lists; analyze transaction data &hellip; and unstructured data (such as email, text, and audio data) to detect evidence of possible money laundering, terrorist financing, bribery, tax evasion, insider trading, market manipulation, and other fraudulent or illegal activities.&rdquo;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span>[6]</span></a></p>
<p><span>For many of these use cases, financial services firms rely on generative AI. However, for use cases that require a high degree of reliability or explainability&mdash;the ability to understand how and why an AI system produces decisions, predictions, or recommendations&mdash;firms are rightly reticent to employ generative AI models.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Regulators Use of AI for SupTech&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The benefits of AI are not limited to the private sector. U.S. regulatory agencies&mdash;including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)&mdash;have begun integrating AI tools into their supervisory functions.</span></p>
<p><span>These agencies use AI to analyze vast quantities of financial data, identify outliers, and detect emerging risks.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"><span>[7]</span></a><span>&nbsp;For example, AI can flag inconsistencies in data submissions from financial institutions, or surface patterns that indicate potential regulatory violations. This use of AI, often referred to as &ldquo;suptech&rdquo; (supervisory technology), enhances regulators&rsquo; ability to carry out their oversight responsibilities efficiently and proactively.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the course of last year, the CFTC undertook extraordinary efforts to begin to clarify the Commission&rsquo;s understanding of registrants&rsquo; use of AI and the potential benefits and limitations of the Commission&rsquo;s implementation of AI for supervisory, surveillance, and enforcement purposes. In January of 2024, I worked with Commission staff to issue a Request for Comment distributed to our market participants to better understand the real-time adoption of AI models.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"><span>[8]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Following the Request for Comment, in December of 2024, the Commission issued a staff advisory on</span><em><span>&nbsp;Use of Artificial Intelligence in CFTC-Regulated Markets</span></em><span>.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9"><span>[9]</span></a><span>&nbsp;One of the most significant takeaways from the staff advisory, which was echoed in executive orders issued by the prior administration, underscore the obligation for CFTC-regulated entities to maintain compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements whether they choose to deploy AI or any other technology.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Addressing the Dark Side of AI</strong></span></p>
<p><span>While AI has the potential to enhance compliance and supervision, it also introduces new risks. Alongside the promise of AI, we must consider the limitations and potential perils of implementing AI quickly without appropriate guardrails. Many of you in the room today, former Commissioner Berkovitz and Professor Cary Coglianese, among others, have participated in joint studies published by the Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) or independently published or presented on these limits.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In previous speeches, I have outlined concerns regarding the implementation of AI models without effective guardrails and governance interventions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a speech earlier this summer, I began to explore the specific concerns that may emerge as firms and regulators integrate agentic AI.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"><span>[10]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The discussion today, in fact, may largely focus on the integration of agentic AI models in compliance, surveillance, and enforcement. If so, I am hopeful that, in parallel to efforts to explore the benefits, panelists examining &ldquo;AI&rsquo;s Role in Regulation Post-Chevron&rdquo; and &ldquo;Regulatory Functions Most Amenable to AI-Drive Process Improvement&rdquo; will also examine important concerns such as the limits of synthetic data, ghosts or hallucinations, data leakage, increasingly undetectable video and voice deepfakes, data accuracy, data security, and data integrity, among others.</span></p>
<p><span>Some bad actors are paving the road for regulators and enforcement actions using AI technology. . But, in many cases, the bad actions are simply traditional, garden variety fraud with an AI white-label.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;AI washing&rdquo;&mdash;the practice of exaggerating or misrepresenting AI capabilities to attract investors or customers</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11"><span>[11]</span></a><span>&mdash;is among the most concerning marketing and solicitation issues that financial market regulators currently face. Firms may claim to use advanced AI models to generate high returns when, in reality, they rely on rudimentary trading bots or nonexistent systems.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"><span>[12]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Enforcement in Action</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC has actively pursued enforcement actions against fraudulent actors who misuse or misrepresent AI. In a landmark case, the Commission obtained a $1.7 billion penalty&mdash;its largest ever&mdash;against a South African company that defrauded investors through a fraudulent multilevel marketing scheme.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"><span>[13]</span></a><span>&nbsp;The company falsely claimed to use a proprietary AI trading bot to generate high returns on Bitcoin investments. In reality, there was no proprietary trading bot and the firm engaged in minimal trading activity, most of which was unprofitable, and misappropriated investor funds.</span></p>
<p><span>This and other cases underscore the CFTC&rsquo;s ability to tackle AI-related misconduct using existing legal tools. The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) provides a robust and flexible framework that prohibits fraudulent and manipulative practices regardless of the underlying technology. For example, CEA Section 4c(a) outlaws disruptive practices such as spoofing,</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"><span>[14]</span></a><span>&nbsp;while CEA Section 6(c)(1) and Regulation 180.1 give the Commission broad anti-fraud and anti-manipulation authority.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15"><span>[15]</span></a><span>&nbsp;These provisions are intentionally technology-neutral, allowing the CFTC to remain agile as new innovations emerge.</span></p>
<p><span>The Commission has demonstrated, through its prior enforcement actions, that markets and market participants engaged in activities that are regulated by the Commission are expected to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, even when such activities occur with cryptocurrencies or through the use of AI. The technology-neutral approach of the CEA and CFTC regulations allows these provisions to be used to combat fraud in any shape, manner, or form.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Strategic Importance of Suptech</strong></span></p>
<p><span>A recent survey by the Financial Stability Institute (FSI) and the Bank for International Settlements Innovation Hub found that only 3 out of 50 supervisory authorities surveyed did not have ongoing suptech initiatives.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"><span>[16]</span></a><span>&nbsp;Those with a comprehensive suptech strategy were significantly more likely to deploy tools critical to supervision.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"><span>[17]</span></a></p>
<p><span>This underscores the importance of not only embracing AI on a case-by-case basis, but also developing cohesive strategies for integrating AI into regulatory and supervisory workflows. By investing in data infrastructure, fostering inter-agency collaboration, and recruiting AI-savvy talent, regulators can better equip themselves to meet the demands of increasingly complex markets.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Finding a Pathway Forward</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I am looking forward to exploring the following principles and their role in our principles-based regulatory framework that I outlined in a speech last year.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18"><span>[18]</span></a><span>&nbsp;As I have previously explained, there are many things that the Commission can do immediately to enhance our understanding of AI and help guide the development of effective guardrails that foster responsible development of AI.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19"><span>[19]</span></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Heightened&nbsp;Penalties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As a CFTC Commissioner, I am also deeply concerned about the potential for abuse of AI technologies to facilitate fraud in our markets. As we examine the development of and limitations on the legitimate uses of AI in our markets, it is also important for the CFTC to emphasize that any misuse of these technologies will draw sharp penalties.</span></p>
<p><span>In fact, I continue to call for the Commission to consider introducing heightened penalties for those who intentionally use AI technologies to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or the evasion of our regulations.</span></p>
<p><span>In many instances, our statutes provide for heightened civil monetary penalties where appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span>I propose that the use of AI in our markets to commit fraud and other violations of our regulations may, in certain circumstances, warrant a heightened civil monetary penalty.</span></p>
<p><span>Bad actors who would use AI to violate our rules must be put on notice and sufficiently deterred from using AI as a weapon to engage in fraud, market manipulation, or to otherwise disrupt the operations or integrity of our markets. We must make it clear that the lure of using AI to engage in new malicious schemes will not be worth the cost.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Recommendation for an&nbsp;Inter-Agency Task Force</strong></span></p>
<p><span>At the end of 2023, the previous administration announced the creation of an AI Safety Institute, which was to be established within the National institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), housed within the Commerce Department.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20"><span>[20]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Shortly thereafter, I proposed the creation of an inter-agency task force composed of financial regulators including the CFTC, SEC, Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, FDIC, Federal Housing Finance Agency, and NCUA to develop guidelines, tools, benchmarks, and best practices for the use and regulation of AI in the financial services industry.</span><a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/opajohnson22?utm_source=govdelivery#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21"><span>[21]</span></a></p>
<p><span>Addressing the perils of AI, while harnessing its promise, is a challenge that will require a whole-of-government approach, with regulators working together across diverse agencies. I continue to advocate for agencies working together to provide their essential experience and expertise to help guide the development of AI standards for the financial industry.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The CFTC, in particular, is well positioned to lead in this space. Its principles-based and technology-neutral approach to regulation allows for flexible oversight that supports innovation while safeguarding market integrity. The Commission's mission&mdash;to foster open, transparent, competitive, and financially sound markets&mdash;naturally aligns with the adoption of cutting-edge technology.</span></p>
<p><span>AI is no longer a futuristic concept&mdash;it is a central feature of modern financial markets. Used responsibly, AI enhances compliance, improves oversight, and enables faster and more effective enforcement. The CFTC&rsquo;s technology-neutral framework allows it to keep pace with innovation while maintaining essential investor protections and market integrity.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for allowing me to share my thoughts with you today. I anticipate you will have an energetic, generative, and thoughtful discussion on the panels and following the presentations this afternoon.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<title>The EBA Launches Consultation On Its Draft Guidelines On Third-Party Risk Management With Regard To Non-ICT Related Services</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on the draft Guidelines on the sound management of third-party risk. The draft Guidelines focus on third-party arrangements in relation to non-ICT related services provided by third-party service providers and their subcontractors with a particular focus on the provision of critical or important functions. These Guidelines revise and update the previous&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/activities/single-rulebook/regulatory-activities/internal-governance/guidelines-outsourcing"><span>EBA Guidelines on outsourcing</span></a><span>, published in 2019, in line with the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA). The consultation runs until 8 October 2025.</span></p>
<p>The draft Guidelines&nbsp;specify the steps to be taken by financial entities for the life cycle of third-party arrangements (i.e. risk assessment, due diligence, contractual phase, sub-contracting, monitoring, exit strategies and termination processes) to ensure consistency with the requirements under the DORA framework to the extent possible.&nbsp;The draft Guidelines provide specific criteria for the application of the proportionality principle.</p>
<p>In addition, the draft Guidelines ensure&nbsp;consistency with the DORA register by allowing financial institutions to store consistent information for both ICT and non-ICT services, including the possibility of using one single register. Taking into account the application of proportionality, the level of information to be documented has been limited to reduce the burden on both financial entities and competent authorities.</p>
<p>To ensure a smooth and efficient transition, financial entities falling under the scope of the updated Guidelines have a transitional period of two years to review and amend their existing third-party arrangements (TPA) and to update the register for non-ICT TPA.</p>
<h4>Consultation process</h4>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper&nbsp;can be sent&nbsp;by clicking on the "send your comments" button on the EBA's consultation page.&nbsp;The&nbsp;deadline for the submission of comments&nbsp;is&nbsp;8 October&nbsp;2025.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on 5 September from 09:00 to 13:00 - Paris time. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-crd6-governance-package-gl-internal-governance-gl-sound-management-third-party-risk">link</a>&nbsp;by 1 September (16:00 CEST).&nbsp;The dial-in details&nbsp;will be communicated&nbsp;to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p>All contributions received&nbsp;will be published&nbsp;following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<h4>Legal basis</h4>
<p>The draft&nbsp;Guidelines&nbsp;have been developed in accordance with Article 74 of Directive 2013/36/EU which mandates the EBA to further harmonise institutions' governance arrangements, processes and mechanisms across the EU. Article 11 of Directive (EU) 2015/2366/EU (PSD2), Article 26 of Directive 2019/2034/EU (IFD), Article 16 of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (MiFID II), Article 34 of Regulation (EU) 2023/1114 (MiCAR) and Article 16 of Regulation (EU) No 1093/2010 have also been taken into account.</p>

The report reflects the weighted responses from a May/June 2025 survey of approximately 10,000 business leaders across 32 economies and 17 sectors.</p>
<div class="PRN_ImbeddedAssetReference" id="DivAssetPlaceHolder1">
<p><img src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2604005/Dun_Bradstreet__Logo.jpg" title="Dun &amp; Bradstreet Logo (PRNewsfoto/Dun &amp; Bradstreet)" /></p>
</div>
<p>Following a 12.9% drop in optimism for Q1 and a modest 1.3% drop for Q2, the Global Business Optimism Index declined another 6.5% amid continued macroeconomic uncertainty and mounting supply chain concerns around the world. The report reveals 54% of business leaders expect trade tensions to either remain unchanged or intensify, while 46% anticipate de-escalation through formal agreements or informal arrangements. Although many central banks have begun cutting interest rates, rate reductions have yet to translate into better financial conditions for many businesses.</p>
<p>"Geopolitical instability in the Middle East, persistent trade frictions and concerns about slowing global demand have contributed to a significant shift in business risk appetite among survey respondents," said Neeraj Sahai, President of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International. "With global conditions remaining unsettled, many businesses are re-evaluating their investment priorities and reinforcing resilience strategies to navigate ongoing uncertainty."</p>
<p>Sector-wise, the global decline in business sentiment was more pronounced in manufacturing<br />(-8.3%) than services (-5.4%). The most affected segments were metal manufacturing, automotives and capital goods &mdash; all of which are exposed to shifts in trade policy and global supply chain dependencies.</p>
<p>Across many industries, businesses are contending with margin compression driven by slowing demand and persistently high input costs. For some, the strategy of raising prices to protect margins is reaching its limits. For example, manufacturers of discretionary spending goods, such as textiles (-17.0%), electricals (-15.0%), metals (-12.7%) and automotives (-9.7%), were among the businesses reporting the largest quarterly declines in optimism with respect to operating margins.</p>
<p><b>Key findings from the Q3 2025 report:</b></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Optimism Index</b>&nbsp;dropped 6.5% amid trade policy uncertainty, softening sales and slowing trade. With continued tariff risks and global demand softening, businesses across emerging and advanced economies are pivoting inward &ndash; turning to domestic markets.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; More than a third (34%) of businesses identified domestic growth as the top fallback strategy in the face of potential tariff escalations.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Supply</b>&nbsp;<b>Chain Continuity Index</b>&nbsp;declined 9.7%, bringing optimism levels down 18.6% year-to-date. Decreases among both advanced and emerging economies suggest systemic global supply chain challenges.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; More than half of the businesses surveyed outside the U.S. are actively seeking alternative international markets or partners beyond the U.S. The EU, at 23%, and Asia &ndash; excluding the Chinese Mainland &ndash; at 15%, emerged as the preferred alternatives. Only 5% of businesses identified the Chinese Mainland as their top fallback for growth, suggesting the geopolitical considerations are now a significant factor in market selection decisions.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Financial Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;contracted 3.4%, with 60% of businesses displaying optimism about cheaper borrowing costs, down from nearly 70% last quarter.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; Less than half of businesses expect to receive timely payment for their goods and services, implying that more businesses appear to be delaying outflows to manage working capital more tightly, in part due to reducing margins.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business Investment Confidence Index</b>&nbsp;fell 13.1%, the third straight decline. Uncertainty surrounding global trade, supply chains and geopolitics has dominated business capital expenditure decisions and pushed confidence lower, despite many major central banks lowering interest rates.<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&ndash; 55.4% of businesses are expecting to raise long&ndash;term funds, a drop from 70% the previous quarter, signifying businesses are not only delaying capital expenditures but are also deleveraging their balance sheets in preparation for long-term disruption.<br /><br /></li>
<li>The&nbsp;<b>Global Business ESG Index</b>, which captures ESG sentiment, held steady, but sharp contrasts emerged. Medium-sized businesses, particularly in emerging economies, posted strong ESG gains, while large businesses in advanced economies saw declines &ndash; likely reflecting compliance strain and evolving disclosure requirements. Large businesses in emerging economies made only marginal gains, while those in advanced economies saw an 8.4% drop, possibly reflecting regulatory fatigue or cost pressures.<br />&ndash; Globally, one in six businesses placed&nbsp;ESG at the core of supplier selection, though it still trails traditional criteria such as cost competitiveness and geopolitical risk profile as primary decision drivers.</li>
</ul>
<p>"In response to this uncertain environment, businesses should look to accelerate strategic shifts in their supply chains. Trade frictions, tariff risks and regulatory volatility are reinforcing the case for friendshoring, nearshoring and multi-sourcing as essential risk-mitigation strategies," said Arun Singh, Global Chief Economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet. "At the same time, businesses are reassessing credit exposure and working capital cycles, with rising payment delays and tighter liquidity underscoring the need for stricter financial management. Agility &mdash; underpinned by real-time data and insights into capital structure, payment behavior, and supplier dependencies &mdash; will be essential for navigating the volatility ahead."</p>
<p>Descriptions and information about the indices can be found on page 29 of the report.</p>
<p><b>About the Global Business Optimism Insights Report</b></p>
<p>The Global Business Optimism Insights report is a synthesis of data from a comprehensive survey encompassing 32 economies, covering approximately 10,000 businesses and 17 sectors, alongside insights from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, leveraging the firm's proprietary data and economic expertise.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<ul type="disc">
<li>New trading service designed to allow retail investors to trade at the best available prices free of charge</li>
<li>Service leverages Cboe's pan-European footprint to offer retail brokers single access point to equities and ETFs across 18 European markets</li>
<li>Builds on Cboe's global leadership in serving retail investor community across multiple asset classes</li>
</ul>
<p>Cboe Europe, operator of the largest pan-European stock exchange by value traded and a division of Global Markets, Inc. (Cboe: CBOE), today announced its plans to launch a retail-focused trading service on its Lit order book designed to enhance execution outcomes for retail investors trading stocks and ETFs across Europe. The service is scheduled to go live on 8 September 2025, subject to receiving the required regulatory non-objections in the Netherlands and the UK.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="prni_dvprnejpg5108left"><img align="middle" alt=" " id="prnejpg5108left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/622233/Cboe_GM_New_Logo.jpg" title=" " /></div>
<p>With Cboe Europe's extensive pan-European market coverage and customer base, this service&nbsp;will offer brokers free execution of retail orders at or better than the&nbsp;European Best Bid and Offer (EBBO)<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;across 18 European markets<sup>2</sup>. The service will operate as part of Cboe Europe's trusted, transparent and regulated exchange environment, which offers access to over&nbsp;8,000 European stocks and ETFs. To support this launch, Cboe Europe is also introducing a&nbsp;dedicated Retail Liquidity Provider (RLP) Programme, designed to enhance retail execution quality by incentivising market makers to post orders at the EBBO which are exclusively for interaction with retail order flow.</p>
<p>Through this new service, retail customers will be able to access some of the best available Lit liquidity in European equities. In addition, retail orders will also be eligible to benefit from free execution on other Cboe Europe trading mechanisms, including its Dark and Periodic Auctions order books, offering potential price improvement opportunities.</p>
<p>Alex Dalley, Head of European Cash Equities, Cboe Global Markets, said: "Cboe is committed to the ongoing evolution of our equity trading services to strengthen European equity markets through the development of a vibrant and inclusive on-exchange ecosystem that benefits all investors. This service is our latest innovation, developed through close collaboration with our retail broker participants seeking to trade at EBBO or better in a simple and cost-effective way. We look forward to leveraging our pan-European footprint, unrivalled range of trading mechanisms and strong industry relationships to enhance the trading experience for retail investors and the firms that support them."</p>
<p>To participate in this service, brokers will be required to complete a Retail Order Attestation form, which enables designated retail orders to access retail-specific pricing and functionality. To support diverse and integrated Lit order books, these retail orders can interact with quotes from both RLPs and non-RLP participants, with executions occurring at the best available prices. When prices are equal, RLP quotes are given priority, and any remaining unmatched quantity may then interact with other available liquidity in the Lit order book. We will have separate market data feeds for RLP and non-RLP orders, enabling brokers the ability to consolidate their view of all orders on our Lit order books.</p>
<p>Existing Cboe Europe participants can access the service through their current connectivity, with many already handling retail order flow and actively sending&nbsp;retail-attested orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe operates 27 markets across five asset classes globally and continues to strengthen its competitive position in serving the global retail investor community. It has strong retail participation in its U.S. options and equities markets, and recently announced plans to introduce&nbsp;24x5 trading&nbsp;for U.S. equities, subject to regulatory approval and industry developments, to meet growing demand from global investors to access U.S. markets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cboe Europe operates exchanges in both the UK (Cboe UK) and the Netherlands (Cboe NL) &ndash; with a combined market share of 25%<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;- offering a comprehensive suite of equity trading services including Lit and Dark books, Periodic Auctions, Cboe BIDS Europe, Cboe BIDS VWAP-X, and Cboe Closing Cross (3C).</p>

<title>BRI Secures Global Recognition As Indonesia's Top Financial Institution In Fortune Southeast Asia 500</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><b>Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk</b>,&nbsp;<b>(IDX: BBRI)</b>, has attained another milestone in its international standing, earning top honors in the&nbsp;<b>2025&nbsp;<i>Fortune Southeast Asia 500</i>&nbsp;list.</b>&nbsp;BRI ranks as the highest-performing financial institutions from Indonesia and claims the 4th position within Southeast Asia financial sector.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg7a41left"><img align="middle" alt="BRI ranks 14th among Southeast Asia&rsquo;s 500 largest corporations by revenue" id="prnejpg7a41left" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2726574/BRI_ranks_14th_Southeast_Asia_s_500_largest_corporations_revenue.jpg" title="BRI ranks 14th among Southeast Asia&rsquo;s 500 largest corporations by revenue" /></div>
<p>BRI is placed 14th among Southeast Asia's 500 largest corporations by revenue. This achievement positions BRI alongside top-tier corporations in the region, even surpassing well-known names such as SEA and Singapore Airlines from Singapore, Charoen Pokphand Foods from Thailand, and Maybank from Malaysia.</p>
<p>This accomplishment is a result of BRI's strong financial performance over the past year. According to Fortune's official publication, BRI recorded USD 17.68 billion in consolidated revenue for the fiscal year, marking an 18.6% year-on-year growth by the end of 2024.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<i>Fortune Southeast Asia 500 2025</i>&nbsp;is the second edition of this annual ranking, which highlights the performance of the largest companies in Southeast Asia based on revenue ending on or before 31 December 2024. All data used has been rigorously verified with the support of global research institutions such as LSEG (London Stock Exchange Group), Bloomberg, and S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
<p>This second edition also emphasizes Southeast Asia's growing strategic role in global supply chain shifts and the rapid growth of industries such as mining, electric vehicles (EVs), and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>
<p><b>BRI President Director Hery Gunardi</b>&nbsp;stated that this achievement is a clear testament to BRI's continued commitment to maintaining solid performance fundamentals amid global economic challenges and dynamics. According to him, this recognition further motivates the company to strengthen BRI's presence both nationally and globally.</p>
<p>"BRI's transformation into a universal banking institution is the answer. BRI aims not only to be the best bank for the MSME segment but also to serve the full spectrum of customer needs, from individuals to large corporations, across all levels of society," he added.</p>
<p>Hery Gunardi also expressed his appreciation to all&nbsp;<i>Insan BRILiaN</i>&nbsp;(BRI employees) and loyal BRI customers. "I am extremely proud, and we dedicate this achievement to all&nbsp;<i>Insan BRILiaN</i>&nbsp;for their outstanding contributions, and to our loyal customers for their unwavering trust in us," he concluded.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority Fines Monzo £21m For Failings In Financial Crime Controls</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 fca-about">
<div class="container">
<p>The FCA has fined Monzo Bank Ltd &pound;21,091,300 for its inadequate anti-financial crime systems and controls between October 2018 and August 2020.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Monzo also repeatedly breached a requirement preventing it from opening accounts for high-risk customers between August 2020 and June 2022.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monzo's customer base has grown rapidly, increasing almost tenfold from around 600,000 in 2018 to over 5.8 million in 2022. However, Monzo's financial crime controls failed to keep pace with its customer and product growth.</p>
<p>In particular, Monzo failed to design, implement and maintain adequate customer onboarding, customer risk assessment and transaction monitoring systems to mitigate the risk of financial crime. These systemic failings resulted in the FCA requiring a comprehensive, independent review of the firm's financial crime framework in August 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside the independent review, the FCA imposed a requirement preventing Monzo from opening new accounts for high-risk customers. However, between August 2020 and June 2022, it repeatedly failed to comply with the terms of the requirement, including signing up over 34,000 high-risk customers.</p>
<p>Therese Chambers, FCA joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p>
<p>'Banks are a vital line of defence in the collective fight against financial crime. They must have the systems in place to prevent the flow of ill-gotten gains into the financial system. Monzo fell far short of what we, and society, expect.</p>
<p>'Monzo onboarded customers on the basis of limited, and in some cases, obviously implausible information &ndash; such as customers using well known London landmarks as an address. This illustrates how lacking Monzo's financial crime controls were. This was compounded by its inability to properly comply with the requirement not to onboard high-risk customers.'</p>
<p>Monzo has established and completed a financial crime change programme to remediate and enhance its wider financial crime control framework in line with recommendations made in the independent review.</p>
<p>The FCA continues to supervise firms to improve standards and ensure that they have the right systems and controls to manage financial crime risks. This is the 10th fine the FCA has imposed on a bank for financial crime control failings in the last 4 years.</p>
<p>The FCA highlighted financial crime as one of its priorities for retail banks in its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/portfolio-letter-fca-strategy-retail-banks-2025.pdf" title="portfolio-letter-fca-strategy-retail-banks-2025.pdf">2024 supervisory strategy (PDF)</a>.</p>

<li>Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/final-notices/monzo-bank-limited.pdf" title="monzo-bank-limited.pdf">Final Notice for Monzo (PDF)</a>.</li>
<li>Monzo would have been fined &pound;30,130,475, but it agreed to resolve these matters and so qualified for a 30% discount under the FCA's processes.</li>

<title>New Research Calls For Realistic Expectations On ESG Investment - Benefits And Highlights Need For Out-Of-Sample Validation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Scientific Beta released&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://scientificbeta.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=605029fd183606b0a853d41cd&amp;id=36f9ff6a37&amp;e=872fda47f5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><strong>new research</strong></a>&nbsp;today that provides a new perspective on investment benefits of using ESG information (Environmental, Social, and Governance metrics).</p>
<p>The study "Does ESG Information Deliver Investment Value? A High-Dimensional Portfolio Perspective" employs rigorous out-of-sample testing methods using 200+ ESG metrics, revealing important insights about the investment potential of ESG information.</p>
<p>Unlike previous studies that focus on single ESG metrics and rely on backward-looking analysis, Scientific Beta's research combines hundreds of ESG characteristics and uses robust portfolio construction methods to evaluate ESG's investment potential. The findings have significant implications for how investors should use ESG information.</p>
<p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> ESG information shows promise in traditional backtests with a 25% increase in Sharpe ratio in-sample. However, these performance gains completely vanished when removing the benefit of hindsight on which metrics outperform. </li>
<li> The dramatic difference between out-of-sample and in-sample results suggests that ESG data not only introduces more information but also additional noise that may cancel any potential benefits. </li>
<li> Optimal use of ESG information requires both tilts to ESG leaders on issues like human rights and tilts to ESG laggards on issues like vice activities, meaning ESG-informed investing doesn't necessarily imply positive sustainability. </li>
<li> Alternative ESG metrics derived from systematic analysis receive substantial weight relative to traditional analyst opinion ratings, challenging conventional ESG rating approaches. </li>
</ul>
<p>The research addresses a critical gap in ESG evaluation by moving beyond traditional backtesting approaches that can suffer from hindsight bias. Instead, the study employs robust out-of-sample testing, providing a more rigorous framework for evaluating ESG's investment potential.</p>
<p>"The findings highlight the critical importance of subjecting investment strategies to rigorous out-of-sample testing," said Felix Goltz, Research Director at Scientific Beta.</p>
<p>"While ESG information may contain valuable insights, investors need realistic expectations about what can be achieved. Most importantly, any claims about the benefits of new investment metrics should be validated through proper out-of-sample testing rather than relying solely on traditional backtest frameworks."</p>
<p>The research contributes to the ongoing debate about ESG investing by providing a more robust analytical framework. Rather than dismissing ESG information, the study calls for more rigorous evaluation standards and realistic expectations about ESG's financial benefits.</p>
<h4><strong>About the Research:</strong></h4>
<p>The study combines 222 ESG characteristics from multiple sources including traditional analyst ratings, academic research metrics, and systematic textual analysis of corporate documents and news. These are evaluated alongside 130 traditional financial characteristics using advanced portfolio construction methods that avoid overfitting to historical data.</p>

<title>Data Cubes Streamline Financial Analysis For Private Equity Firms, Says iFinance Director</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div>
<p><span>The data cube is transforming the private equity landscape, enhancing decision-making, expediting due diligence and optimising exit strategies</span><span>,</span><span>&nbsp;according to expert insight from iFinance Director (iFD).</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>In an in-depth guide to the data cube, a multi-dimensional data model that organises and segments critical financial data, iFD highlights the key advantages of using the model and explains why it is</span>&nbsp;<span>essential in today&rsquo;s data-rich environment.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Greg Eaton, Managing Director at iFD</span>&nbsp;<span>said of the model:&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;In today&rsquo;s private equity landscape, the ability to access clear, segmented financial data is no longer a luxury; it is a necessity.</span>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>&ldquo;Tools like the data cube allow investors to move beyond surface-level metrics, providing the depth of insight needed to make informed decisions quickly and with confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>The data cube enhances financial analysis in several ways, including:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li> <span>Granular analysis of profitability:</span><span>&nbsp;The core advantage of a data cube is its ability to break down sales and margin data by customer type, product line, service or geography, giving businesses a flexible, detailed view of profitability across multiple dimensions.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Streamlining due diligence and reducing risk:</span><span>&nbsp;Traditional due diligence can be time-consuming, especially if financial data is not readily available or does not provide the depth required.</span><span>&nbsp;</span> </li>
<li> <span>Preparation for a smooth exit process:</span><span>&nbsp;A data cube-ready setup gives buyers clear financial insights, reducing risk and making the company more attractive and valuable.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span> </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div><span>Alongside this, there are several key benefits that can aid private equity investors, such as:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br /></span></div>
<div>
<ul>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To support banks in accelerating their transition to real-time Swift payments ahead of the October 2025 European deadline, global fintech leader&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.broadridge.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.</a>&nbsp;(NYSE:BR) has announced the significant market adoption of its service for connectivity, message processing and workflow management for instant payments. This move follows robust take-up by European banks, reflecting Broadridge&rsquo;s commitment to enhancing the speed and efficiency of financial transactions across the continent.</p>
<p><i>"With instant payments now a regulatory necessity, financial institutions are actively looking for scalable and cost-efficient solutions that ensure seamless compliance and real-time payment readiness,"</i>&nbsp;<b>said Kai Marzenell, Director,&nbsp;Swift Product Management at Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;<i>"Our solution not only minimizes onboarding complexity but also offers financial institutions a significant cost advantage, enabling them to better operate, innovate and grow.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Since launching the solution in the fall of 2024, Broadridge has successfully onboarded seven clients in just five months, enabling real-time payments through partnerships with key core banking solution providers, such as&nbsp;<a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="http://www.cpb-software.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CPB SOFTWARE</a>&nbsp;(formerly EFDIS), as well as instant payment application providers, such as Foconis. By providing seamless integration with the European Central Bank&rsquo;s Target Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system, Broadridge has provided banks with a high-availability infrastructure that ensures transactions settle 24/7, with zero downtime.</p>
<p><b><i>"</i></b><i>Speed of onboarding was a game-changer in this collaboration,"</i>&nbsp;<b>said Christian Wust, Managing Director at CPB SOFTWARE (GERMANY) GMBH.</b>&nbsp;<i>"While most providers require six months or more per institution, Broadridge helped our clients go live in just five months, covering multiple banks in that timeframe. This level of agility is a major advantage in today&rsquo;s fast-moving payments environment."</i></p>
<p>Broadridge&rsquo;s instructing party model developed in collaboration with the European Central Bank&rsquo;s TIPS system, has been a key factor in client adoption, significantly reducing costs, simplifying compliance and minimizing time to market.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;With the October 2025 deadline for full compliance approaching, banks are under pressure to meet instant payment requirements,&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;<b>said Heidi Dittmar, managing director of Swift Services, Broadridge.</b>&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;Working with Broadridge has enabled our customers to integrate real-time payments efficiently and navigate the evolving regulatory landscape with confidence."</i></p>
<p>Broadridge&rsquo;s infrastructure offers &ldquo;active-active&rdquo; failover across two data centers ensuring uninterrupted service availability. This capability significantly reduces risk and enhances resilience by allowing banks to rigorously pre-test failover scenarios under real-world conditions, setting a new benchmark for instant payment infrastructure.</p>
<p>Additionally, Broadridge&rsquo;s partnerships with CPB SOFTWARE and Foconis have been instrumental in enabling rapid deployment for financial institutions.</p>
<p>Broadridge&rsquo;s service for instant payments is built for continuous operation, processing transactions in less than 10 seconds with no downtime, with SwiftNet Instant connectivity for enhanced efficiency. This allows banks to support high-volume transactions, not only for the current set of instant payment transactions, but also in readiness for the future transition of all payment types to the instant payment model.</p>

<title>Euronext Launches The First Phase Of Its Strategic Multi-Year Repo Expansion Initiative - This Initiative Expands Access, Improves Collateral Usage, And Positions Euronext As A Leading Central Counterparty (CCP) For European Repo Markets</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-launches-the-first-phase-of-its-strategic-multi-year-repo-expansion-ini-202578/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/euronext-launches-the-first-phase-of-its-strategic-multi-year-repo-expansion-ini-202578/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Euronext today announced the launch of the Repo Foundation, the first phase of a bold, multi-year strategy to expand access, improve margin efficiency, and challenge legacy models in Europe&rsquo;s secured financing markets. As a cornerstone of Euronext&rsquo;s strategic plan announced in November 2024, Innovate for Growth 2027, the Repo Expansion Initiative sets in motion Euronext&rsquo;s vision to build a fully integrated, pan-European post-trade infrastructure.</p>
<p>Building on over 25 years as a leading CCP for repos on Italian government bonds, this expansion marks the beginning of a phased rollout that will extend access to international participants and introduce new clearing benefits across Europe&rsquo;s sovereign debt markets.</p>
<p>Amid structural shifts in the global repo ecosystem and heightened regulatory focus on collateral and clearing frameworks and transparency, including regulatory reform under EMIR 3.0, and margin, liquidity and collateral priorities set out by standard setting industry bodies (such as FSB, BCBS, IOSCO) &ndash; Euronext is taking a proactive approach to building a more integrated and resilient European market infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over the past years, Euronext has profoundly transformed Euronext Clearing into one of the top three clearing houses in Europe. The Repo Foundation marks a pivotal expansion of Euronext Clearing&rsquo;s capabilities, opening secured financing services to international counterparties and introducing key enhancements in margin efficiency, risk management, and collateral optimisation.</p>
<p><span>Anthony Attia, Global Head of Derivatives and Post Trade at Euronext, said:</span><em>&nbsp;&ldquo;The launch of the Repo Foundation is a major step forward in the delivery of Euronext&rsquo;s Innovate for Growth 2027 strategy. The structure of the European repo market is shifting, and firms are demanding more than access &mdash; they need real solutions that support capital efficiency, reduce costs, simplify operations, and align with evolving regulatory requirements. The Repo Foundation is the first phase of our wider Repo Expansion Initiative &mdash; a multi-year strategy to deliver a fully integrated, pan-European clearing model. With a strong footprint in Italian repo, a growing list of government bond coverage, and the majority of key clearing members already connected, Euronext is well positioned to become the clearing house of choice for European repo.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><span>Expanded clearing access and market coverage</span></p>
<p>With Repo Foundation, Euronext now offers repo clearing for Spanish, Portuguese, and Irish government bonds, alongside its established Italian offering. For the first time, international firms can join the platform &mdash; either through existing Euronext connections or as repo-only participants &mdash; with seamless onboarding and scalable settlement operations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the third quarter of 2025, coverage will be extended to include French, German, Dutch, and Belgian government bonds, as well as euro-denominated supranational issuances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter of 2025, Austrian and Finnish government bonds will be added, completing Euronext&rsquo;s initial expansion of sovereign collateral coverage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 2026, clients will also gain access to competitive and liquid General Collateral (GC) baskets, built with a leading Triparty Agent (TPA), with risk offsets across correlated collateral. Clients will benefit from cross-margining across debt instruments within a single margin account (subject to regulatory approval) &mdash; improving capital efficiency and risk management in line with global expectations for margin transparency and procyclicality controls.&nbsp;These enhancements are part of a broader drive to deliver tangible margin savings, with a redesigned risk model and updated margin methodologies offering meaningful cost advantages versus legacy clearing models.</p>
<p>To further broaden market participation, Euronext clearing will introduce a sponsored access model in the second quarter of 2026. This functionality will allow buyside firms to access repo clearing without becoming direct clearing members, opening the door to a wider segment of market participants. Sponsored access will support greater liquidity, improve counterparty risk management, and help firms meet evolving regulatory and capital requirements &mdash; all within a secure, scalable clearing framework.</p>
<p>By the third quarter of 2026, the full Repo Expansion Initiative will be in place &mdash; enabling clients to access the complete functionality, product coverage and capital benefits. This progressive expansion leverages Euronext&rsquo;s established clearing network and supports streamlined onboarding across fixed income markets.</p>
<p><span>Enabling collateral optimisation</span></p>
<p>A core pillar of Repo Foundation, and the wider Repo Expansion Initiative, is enabling more effective use of collateral. This includes &nbsp;broadening eligible assets, with currencies such as USD, GBP and NOK becoming available from launch,&nbsp;and further expansion planned &mdash; to give clients greater flexibility in how they meet margin requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Complementing this,&nbsp;Euronext will also introduce a new triparty agent (TPA) model, starting with Euroclear in the third quarter of 2025 and followed by Clearstream in the fourth quarter of 2025.&nbsp;Additional strategic alliances will follow.&nbsp;These integrations are designed to streamline settlement, reduce operational burden, and enable real-time collateral mobility &mdash; improving capital efficiency while maintaining full regulatory compliance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These enhancements are part of a broader drive to deliver tangible margin savings, with a redesigned risk model and updated margin methodologies. Euronext anticipates increased migration of activity towards its new clearing model, as market participants seek out more cost-effective and scalable solutions.</p>

<title>Adhara And ioBuilders Merge To Create Leading Global Provider Of Blockchain-Based Software Products And Services For Financial Institutions</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adhara-and-iobuilders-merge-to-create-leading-global-provider-of-blockchain-base-202578/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/adhara-and-iobuilders-merge-to-create-leading-global-provider-of-blockchain-base-202578/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Adhara and ioBuilders have joined forces to form a leading independent provider of blockchain-based software products and services for financial institutions. The new company, headquartered in London, is profitable, with over 120 employees across the UK, Spain, South Africa, and Singapore, and generates double-digit million euro revenues annually. It offers a full product suite in digital cash, tokenized lending, and securities &ndash; helping financial institutions move from proof-of-concept to production.</p>
<div dir="ltr" id="dvprnejpg5edaleft"><img align="middle" alt="Adhara and ioBuilders merge to lead blockchain products and solutions for financial institutions." id="prnejpg5edaleft" src="https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2724302/Adhara_Logo.jpg" title="Adhara and ioBuilders merge to lead blockchain products and solutions for financial institutions." /></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adhara, established in 2018, has pioneered real-time digital cash and settlement systems globally. Founded in 2018, ioBuilders has delivered tokenized financial platforms for regulated institutions worldwide. Both companies were early adopters of enterprise-grade Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), with a strong focus on Enterprise Ethereum based platforms. These technologies &mdash; including Ethereum, Hyperledger Besu, and Hedera Hashgraph &mdash; have become foundational for regulated digital asset systems due to their maturity, ecosystem depth, and ability to support the scalability, privacy, and interoperability requirements of financial institutions.</p>
<p>The new entity has already been publicly associated with leading global financial institutions such as Santander, BBVA, Deutsche Bank, UBS, DTCC, IDB, Lloyds, Allfunds, and Renta 4 Banco; as well as financial market infrastructures like SIX/BME and Fnality; and ecosystem players including Partior, Garrigues, Deloitte, Fireblocks, Ownera, and Hedera. With operations across EMEA, the Americas, and Asia, its platforms &ndash; including DC Commander, DC Issuance, and Asseto Markets &ndash; are in production, supporting use cases from deposit token and stablecoin issuance to tokenized loans, funds, bonds, and equities.</p>
<p>Adhara is the software partner for Fnality, the first wholesale digital cash system in commercial use. It has delivered blockchain-based systems for settlement, payments, and fund distribution. ioBuilders complements this with regulatory-grade platforms for digital lending, and tokenized securities, used by leading banks, asset managers and financial market infrastructures across Europe.</p>
<p>Carlos Matilla, CEO of ioBuilders, takes the role of CEO of the combined entity. Peter Munnings, co-founder of Adhara, becomes COO, and Adhara founder Julio Faura assumes the role of Chairman.</p>
<p>"This is a pivotal moment for the financial industry", Julio Faura, CEO at Adhara, said. "With banks and financial market infrastructures moving beyond PoCs into production, the maturity of Digital Cash and Digital Assets is clear. Adhara and ioBuilders together create the leading enterprise Ethereum provider helping clients thrive in this digital era."</p>
<p>Carlos Matilla, CEO of ioBuilders, said: "Bringing together Adhara and ioBuilders is a big step forward. By combining proven digital cash products with real-world asset tokenization platforms and deep delivery experience, we're creating a one-stop partner for financial institutions to move from pilot to production and drive DLT adoption.''</p>
<p>This transaction follows Adhara's Series A round led by Yabeo and Force Over Mass Capital, with participation from ConsenSys and others.</p>
<p>"As one of the earliest incubated projects at Consensys Mesh, Adhara saw the potential to transform TradFi before most.&nbsp; By bringing them together with ioBuilders, the combined talent and products are well positioned to capitalize on the new banking order that now sees the power of stablecoins, tokenized deposits and cross-border payments", said Joe Lubin, co-founder of Ethereum and Chairman of Consensys Mesh. "We look forward to Adhara's future partnerships that collectively expands our ecosystem and client efficiencies".</p>
<p>Gerrit Seidel, General Partner of Yabeo adds: "The merged company is the leading bank-to-bank blockchain technology provider worldwide and bound to replace incumbent banking software players in the next years."</p>
<p><i>The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals.</i></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<h2>"Cold-calling"</h2>
<p class="indent">"Cold-calling" is&nbsp;<strong>a&nbsp;fraudulent practice</strong>&nbsp;where by an entity disguises itself as a brokerage firm or an asset management firm and&nbsp;<strong>approaches potential investors via non face-to-face channels</strong>, such as by phone, fax, and emails, in order to solicit investment in securities or financial products.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="indent">Typical characteristics of &ldquo;cold-callers&rdquo; include:</p>
<ul class="mt20 mb20">
<li><strong>Lack of registration or authorization to solicit securities transactions</strong></li>
<li><strong>Difficulty in identifying their location</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pretending to be trustworthy entities</strong></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><strong>Investors are strongly advised to check the list of registered entities</strong>&nbsp;on the Financial Services Agency (FSA) website, such as the &ldquo;<a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/en/regulated/licensed/index.html">List of licensed (registered) Financial Institutions</a>,&rdquo; to verify whether a company is properly registered in Japan as a securities firm or investment advisor.&nbsp;<strong>If the company is not registered, investors should exercise extreme caution and consider refraining from any transactions with it.</strong></p>
<h2>Suspected Cold-callers</h2>
<p class="indent">If any of the following entities are soliciting securities investments, there is a strong suspicion of cold calling.</p>
<p><img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/ordinary/cold/20250620-1.pdf">"Cold Calling" - Non-Registered and/or Non-Authorized Entities</a>,&nbsp;<img alt="excel" class="excel" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_excel.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/ordinary/cold/20250620-1.xlsx">"Cold Calling" - Non-Registered and/or Non-Authorized Entities</a>&nbsp;(as of June 20, 2025)</p>
<p class="indent">If an entity claims to be registered or authorized by any of the following non-existent Japanese government agencies, it is likely to be a cold caller.</p>
<p><img alt="PDF" class="pdf" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_pdf.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/ordinary/cold/20250620-2.pdf">Non-Existing Governmental Bodies</a>,&nbsp;<img alt="excel" class="excel" src="https://www.fsa.go.jp/images/common/icon_excel.gif" /><a href="https://www.fsa.go.jp/ordinary/cold/20250620-2.xlsx">Non-Existing Governmental Bodies</a>&nbsp;(as of June 20, 2025)</p>
<ul class="no_icon in-1hang mt20 mb20">
<li>
<p>* These lists include information provided to the FSA by foreign authorities and investors who have suffered losses overseas. Some listed cold-callers may not actually exist, and there may be other suspicious entities not included in the list. New entities may be added in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* There have been cases where different companies were located in addresses indicated in the list. The fact that the address is put in the list does not mean that such companies have any connection to the listed entities. There have been cases where the address does not exist.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) today issued a proclamation allowing national banks, federal savings associations, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks to close offices in areas of Texas affected by flooding.</p>
<p>In issuing the proclamation, the OCC expects that only those bank offices directly affected by potentially unsafe conditions will close. Those offices should make every effort to reopen as quickly as possible to address the banking needs of their customers.</p>
<p>OCC Bulletin 2012-28, &ldquo;Supervisory Guidance on Natural Disasters and Other Emergency Conditions&rdquo; (September 21, 2012), provides guidance on actions bankers could consider implementing when their bank or savings association operates or has customers in areas affected by a natural disaster or other emergency.</p>

<title>The EBA Consults On Draft Guidelines On Ancillary Services Undertakings</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-draft-guidelines-on-ancillary-services-undertakings-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/the-eba-consults-on-draft-guidelines-on-ancillary-services-undertakings-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today launched a public consultation on its draft Guidelines on Ancillary Services Undertakings (ASUs). The draft Guidelines set out clear, simple and consistent criteria for the identification of activities referred under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). The consultation runs until 7 October 2025.</span></p>
<p>The proper identification of ASUs is essential to ensure the consistent and effective application of the prudential framework. It plays a key role in determining the scope of prudential consolidation for banking groups, thereby enabling institutions to comply with the obligations laid down in the CRR on a consolidated basis.</p>
<p>The draft Guidelines set the criteria for the identification of: (a) activities that should be considered a &ldquo;direct extension of banking&rdquo;; and (b) activities that should be considered &ldquo;ancillary to banking&rdquo;. They also outline the process to identify activities that the EBA may consider&nbsp;similar to those referred to in the CRR to ensure that the guidelines remain responsive to emerging sources of risks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The objective of the draft Guidelines is to promote convergence in institutions and supervisory practices regarding the identification of ASUs, with the aim of ensuring a level playing field and enhancing the comparability of prudential requirements across the EU.</p>
<p><span>Consultation process</span></p>
<p>Comments to the consultation paper can be sent by clicking on the "send your comments" on the EBA's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/publications-and-media/events/consultation-guidelines-ancillary-services-undertakings" title="Consultation on Guidelines on Ancillary Services Undertakings">consultation page</a>. The deadline for the submission of comments is 7 October 2025. The EBA will consider the feedback received to this consultation when finalising the Guidelines.</p>
<p>All contributions received will be published following the end of the consultation, unless requested otherwise.</p>
<p>The EBA will hold a virtual public hearing on the consultation paper on 2 September 2025 from 10:00 to 11:30 CET. The EBA invites interested stakeholders to register using this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/public-hearing-guidelines-ancillary-services-undertakings-asu">link</a>&nbsp;by 26 August&nbsp; 2025 at 18:00. The dial-in details will be communicated to those who have registered for the meeting.</p>
<p><span>Legal basis and background</span></p>
<p>The draft Guidelines were developed as part of the planned EBA&rsquo;s actions&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/EBA%20Roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="https://www.eba.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-12/9dc534e8-8a3d-438f-88e3-bc86e623d99e/eba%20roadmap%20on%20strengthening%20the%20prudential%20framework_1.pdf">&nbsp;for the implementation of the EU banking package</a>. They deliver on the mandate laid down&nbsp;in Article 4(5)&nbsp;of the CRR, whereby the EBA shall issue guidelines specifying the criteria for the identification of activities that are performed by ancillary services undertakings, as referred to in points (a), (b) and (c) of Article 4(1)(18) of the CRR.</p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/page/small-business-capital-formation-advisory-committee">Small Business Capital Formation Advisory Committee</a>&nbsp;announced that it will hold a meeting at the SEC Headquarters in Washington D.C on Tuesday, July 22, 2025 at 10 a.m. E.T. The meeting will be open to the public, in-person, as well as webcast on the SEC website, and will explore Regulation A and the topic of &ldquo;finders,&rdquo; persons who assist companies with limited capital-raising activities in private markets.</p>
<p>The meeting will start by finalizing discussion of potential regulatory improvements to Regulation A, building upon ideas generated during the previous committee meeting. In keeping with the committee&rsquo;s efforts to promote small business capital formation, including access to capital for founders who are building businesses outside of prominent entrepreneurial hubs or without robust capital-raising networks, the committee will spend the remainder of the meeting exploring &ldquo;finders&rdquo; and related matters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Staff from the SEC&rsquo;s Division of Trading and Markets will provide the committee with an overview of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/exorders/2020/34-90112.pdf">SEC&rsquo;s 2020 release</a>, which proposed a limited, conditional exemption from broker registration for &ldquo;finders.&rdquo; The committee will also learn more about the role of &ldquo;finders&rdquo; and possible regulatory solutions from industry practitioners Gary Ross, Managing Partner at Ross Law Group, and Kelley Arena, Founder at Golden Hour Ventures. As part of this discussion, the committee will explore potential principles, frameworks, conditions, and safeguards that could permit certain &ldquo;finders&rdquo; to engage in limited capital-raising activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Saudi Exchange announced the launch of the Saudi Depositary Receipts (SDRs), introducing a new financial instrument that provide investors in the Saudi Capital Market with ease of access to shares of listed foreign companies in global capital markets. This milestone marks another significant step in positioning the Saudi market as a leading global financial hub.</p>
<p>Saudi Depositary Receipts facilitate investor access to foreign companies listed on other exchanges, with the ability to trade and settle in Saudi Riyals. In addition, SDRs offer liquidity and flexibility, facilitating the transfer of the security between the Saudi Capital Market and the foreign exchanges by enabling the conversion of the SDR into shares in the foreign exchange, which provides the opportunity to trade the company&rsquo;s shares in two different exchanges.</p>
<p>On this occasion, Mohammed Al-Rumaih, CEO of the Saudi Exchange, said: "The launch of SDRs represents a major milestone in our efforts towards fostering the Saudi Capital Market&rsquo;s position as a global financial hub. Through this recently introduced financial instrument, we are offering investors the opportunity to engage with global businesses and diversifying the investment landscape. We will maintain our commitment to advancing the competitiveness of the Saudi Capital Market and creating new opportunities for investors and issuers."</p>
<p>Hanan Al Shehri, CEO of the Securities Depository Center Company (Edaa), said: "By leveraging recent enhancements from our post-trade infrastructure enhancement program, including Edaa&rsquo;s straight-through processing and streamlined communication systems, we have established a robust framework that further supports financial instruments registration. The launch of SDRs demonstrates our dedication to supporting the dynamism of the Saudi Capital Market on a regional and global level."</p>
<p>The introduction of SDRs marks a significant milestone in the Saudi Exchange&rsquo;s mission to enhance capital market accessibility and expand investment opportunities for investors in the Saudi market. This initiative aligns with the Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) under Saudi Vision 2030.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Tradeweb Markets Inc. (Nasdaq: TW), a leading, global operator of electronic marketplaces for rates, credit, equities and money markets, today reported total trading volume for the month of June 2025 of $52.0 trillion (tn)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-june-2025-total-trading-volume-of--$52.0-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$2.4-trillion#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><span>[1]</span></a>. Average daily volume (ADV) for the month was $2.4tn, an increase of 25.9 percent (%) year-over-year (YoY). For the second quarter of 2025, total trading volume was a record $165.3tn and ADV was a record $2.6tn, an increase of 32.7% YoY, with preliminary average variable fees per million dollars of volume traded of $2.30 and total preliminary fixed fees for rates, credit, equities and money markets of $93.8 million (mm)<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-june-2025-total-trading-volume-of--$52.0-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$2.4-trillion#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span>[2]</span></a>. Excluding the impact of the ICD acquisition, which closed on August 1, 2024, total ADV for the month of June was up 13.0% YoY.</p>
<p>Tradeweb CEO Billy Hult said: &ldquo;Tradeweb closed out the second quarter with a solid performance through the end of June, reflecting increased client engagement of electronic trading amid a backdrop of elevated market activity. The quarter was marked by several notable events, including heightened volatility in April&mdash;brought on by evolving central bank policy expectations, new U.S. tariffs announced around Liberation Day and rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East&mdash;all of which influenced trading activity across the broader financial ecosystem. The fact that electronic trading remained sticky through this market turbulence shows how firmly it's taken hold as a go-to strategy for our clients, even in times of stress.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Record Highlights:</span></strong></p>
<p>For the second quarter of 2025, Tradeweb records included:</p>
<ul>
<li>ADV in U.S. government bonds</li>
<li>ADV in U.S. swaps/swaptions &lt; 1-year</li>
<li>ADV in fully electronic U.S. high yield credit</li>
<li>ADV in municipal bonds</li>
<li>ADV in European ETFs</li>
<li>ADV in global repurchase agreements</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">June 2025 Highlights</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>rates</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was up 6.1% YoY to $223.6 billion (bn). European government bond ADV was up 10.0% YoY to $55.6bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. government bond ADV was led by strong activity in the wholesale client channel. Robust European government bond ADV was driven by strong volumes in our institutional client channel. Strong activity in the U.S. and Europe was supported by an increased number of clients trading across a diverse set of trading protocols.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mortgage ADV was up 8.4% YoY to $226.5bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>To-Be-Announced (TBA) activity was primarily driven by continued elevated dollar-roll trading and an uptick in engagement from fast money accounts. Tradeweb&rsquo;s specified pool platform reported strong volumes driven by a record number of clients executing on the platform.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year ADV was up 13.2% YoY to $494.9bn and total rates derivatives ADV was up 6.0% YoY to $828.8bn.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> 
<ul>
<li>Swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year saw a strong increase in risk trading activity YoY driven by U.S. tariff policy, as well as rising tensions in the Middle East, which caused global market uncertainty. This was supported by a 9% YoY increase in compression activity, which carries a relatively lower fee per million. 2Q25 compression activity as a percentage of swaps/swaptions &ge; 1-year was lower than 1Q25.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span><span>credit</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Fully electronic U.S. credit ADV was up 14.1% YoY to $8.1bn and European credit ADV remained flat YoY at $2.5bn. 
<ul>
<li>U.S. credit volumes were driven by increased client adoption of Tradeweb protocols, most notably in request-for-quote (RFQ), Portfolio Trading, and Tradeweb AllTrade&reg;. Tradeweb captured 19.6% and 8.0% share of fully electronic U.S high grade and U.S. high yield TRACE, respectively, as measured by Tradeweb. We also reported 27.0% total share of U.S. high grade TRACE and 10.4% total share of U.S. high yield TRACE. European credit volumes were suppressed by geopolitical events early in the month but stabilized later as the month progressed due to record new issuance and strong client activity in Tradeweb&rsquo;s Automated Intelligent Execution (AiEX) tool. Cash credit Portfolio Trading ADV increased 4% YoY, with non-comp Portfolio Trading ADV increasing by 8% YoY. Portfolio Trading carries a relatively lower FPM to the broader cash credit average, with non-comp Portfolio Trading carrying a lower FPM than Portfolio Trading overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Municipal bonds ADV was up 20.8% YoY to $494.8mm. 
<ul>
<li>Municipal bonds reported strong growth across the retail and institutional platforms, outpacing the broader market, which was up 14.9% YoY.<a href="https://www.tradeweb.com/newsroom/media-center/news-releases/tradeweb-reports-june-2025-total-trading-volume-of--$52.0-trillion-and-average-daily-volume-of-$2.4-trillion#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"><span>[3]</span></a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Credit derivatives ADV was down 18.5% YoY to&nbsp;$12.0bn. 
<ul>
<li>Lower credit market volatility led to subdued swap execution facility (SEF) and multilateral trading facility (MTF) credit default swaps activity.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>equities&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>U.S. ETF ADV was down 4.5% YoY to $7.7bn and European ETF ADV was up 15.8% YoY to $3.3bn. 
<ul>
<li>Tradeweb&rsquo;s global institutional ETF volumes increased YoY as more clients joined the platform and existing clients continued to increase their usage of Tradeweb&rsquo;s AiEX tool. U.S. ETF wholesale volumes were lower YoY primarily due to a reduction in equity market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span>money markets&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Repo ADV was up 27.7% YoY to $765.1bn. 
<ul>
<li>Global repo trading activity was supported by increased client participation across the platform. In the U.S., strong growth was driven by the effects of the Fed&rsquo;s balance sheet unwind. Additionally, balances in the Fed&rsquo;s reverse repo facility (RRP) remained at relatively low levels throughout most of the month, despite an increase into month-end. In Europe, volumes were driven by increased government bond issuance as well as market volatility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other Money Markets ADV was up YoY to $275.7bn. 
<ul>
<li>Other money markets volume was driven by the inclusion of ICD volumes in June 2025.</li>

<title>Moscow Exchange: Changes To The Formula For Calculating Additional Fee</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/moscow-exchange-changes-to-the-formula-for-calculating-additional-fee-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/moscow-exchange-changes-to-the-formula-for-calculating-additional-fee-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Dear MOEX clients,</p>
<p>Starting from July 25, 2025, a revised formula for calculating Additional Fee will be introduced in the Securities Market section.</p>
<ul>
<li>The coefficient M is reduced fivefold, from the current 1.0 to 0.02, thereby lowering the final Additional Fee.</li>
<li>The coefficient k is increased from 0.05 (five hundredths) to 0.07 (seven hundredths).</li>
<li>The asset liquidity coefficient L, as previously, takes values of either 0.5 or 1.0 depending on the presence of the market maker flag, but it is now considered at an earlier stage.</li>
<li>A new multiplier K_i is introduced to calculate the normalized number of orders related to the Passive Only flag, which can take values of 0.5 or 1.0.</li>
<li>The parameter Orders_i_type is introduced to denote the number of orders submitted by the User on behalf of themselves or their Client into the Exchange Trading System for each trading day according to the order type (i).</li>
<li>The value of <b>Orders</b> is updated to represent the normalized number of actual orders submitted. This plays a crucial role in recalculating orders exceeding the threshold of 1 million units/day.</li>
<li>The daily ceiling for Additional Fee is increased from 300,000 RUB to 1.5 million RUB.</li>
</ul>
<p>The revised document titled "Additional fees and charges stipulated in the integrated IT Service Agreement" has been published on the Exchange website: <a href="https://fs.moex.com/files/18033">https://fs.moex.com/files/18033</a> (Russian only).</p>
<p>Corresponding changes are being made to the EQM16 report format, "Clearing participant&rsquo;s liabilities on Additional Fee". Participants will be able to use the following additional lines of information for Additional Fee calculation verification:</p>
<p>Changes in RECORDS node attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New attribute <b>NumOrdersALL</b>: Number of orders for Additional fee calculation</li>
<li>New attribute <b>SumNumOrdersMM</b>: The actual number of non-market maker orders, excluding those with the 'Passive Only' flag, used for calculating the adjusted count</li>
<li>New attribute <b>SumNumOrdersMMPO</b>: The actual number of market maker orders with the 'Passive Only' flag, used for calculating the adjusted count</li>
<li>New attribute <b>SumNumOrdersPO</b>: The actual number of non-market maker orders with the 'Passive Only' flag, used for calculating the adjusted count</li>
<li>New attribute <b>SumNumOrders</b>: The actual number of non-market maker orders, excluding those with the 'Passive Only' flag, used for calculating the adjusted count</li>
<li>The attribute <b>NumOrdersGTA</b> is renamed to <b>NumOrdersALL</b> to display the total number of orders for Additional fee calculation purposes</li>
<li>The purpose of the attribute <b>NumOrdersGTA</b> is changed to represent the normalized order count for Additional fee calculation</li>
<li>The attribute <b>NumMMOrdersGTA</b> is removed &ndash; Number of market making orders for Additional fee calculation</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in DETAILS node attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>New attribute <b>NumOrdersCode</b>: Number of orders</li>
<li>New attribute <b>NumOrdersMM</b>: Number of market maker orders, excluding those with the 'Passive Only' flag</li>
<li>New attribute <b>NumOrdersMMPO</b>: Number of market maker orders with the 'Passive Only' flag</li>

</ul>
<p>Updated specifications for report formats are available on the MOEX website: <a href="https://fs.moex.com/files/13900">https://fs.moex.com/files/13900</a>.</p>

<title>ICE Mortgage Monitor: Amid A Cooling Housing Market, Early Signs Of Homeowner Risk Emerge - Rising Negative Equity, Affordability Workarounds, And Student Loan Burdens Point To Growing Financial Strain For Some Homeowners</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-amid-a-cooling-housing-market-early-signs-of-homeowner-ri-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/ice-mortgage-monitor-amid-a-cooling-housing-market-early-signs-of-homeowner-ri-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ICE Mortgage Technology, a neutral provider of a robust end-to-end mortgage platform and part of Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (NYSE: ICE), today released its July 2025 Mortgage Monitor report. ICE data reveals that beneath the surface of a broadly cooling but stable housing market, early signs of financial stress are emerging among subsets of homeowners. Pockets of vulnerability can be seen in rising negative equity, increased use of mortgage products that improve short-term affordability, and exposure to student loan debt.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Softening home prices expand from the Sunbelt to Western states, driving increased negative equity</span></li>
</ul>
<p>According to ICE&rsquo;s Home Price Index, annual home price growth slowed to 1.3% in early June, and 30% of the largest markets have seen prices dip by at least a full percentage point from their recent highs. While this deceleration may help affordability, it could potentially weaken the equity positions of borrowers who purchased more recently, particularly those using FHA and VA loans, which are low down payment products. Nationally, one in four seriously delinquent loans would be in a negative equity position if sold at distressed (REO) prices. In certain markets, the figures are more pronounced: in Cape Coral, Fla., 27% of all 2023 and 2024 vintage loans are now underwater, while in Austin, Texas, the rate is 18% among 2022 vintage loans.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>ARM and temporary buydown usage reflect affordability pressure</span></li>
</ul>
<p>More than 8% of borrowers financed homes with ARMs or temporary buydowns this year, which reduce monthly payments in the first years of the loan. While these loans provide short-term relief, they may introduce future payment shock, particularly if interest rates remain elevated or reset higher.</p>
<ul class="bwlistdisc">
<li><span>Student loan delinquency greatly increases mortgage delinquency risk</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The return of both payments and collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, which resumed in May after a five-year pause, may put additional financial strain on some homeowners. Analysis of ICE McDash data and ICE Tradelines data powered by TransUnion shows that nearly 20% of mortgage holders also carry student loan debt. Among FHA borrowers, that number rises to nearly 30%. Borrowers delinquent on student loans are four times more likely to be delinquent on their mortgage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the slowdown in home price growth may be easing affordability pressures, and negative equity volumes remain low, we&rsquo;re beginning to see localized pockets of recent homebuyers becoming financially exposed,&rdquo; said Andy Walden, Head of Mortgage and Housing Market Research at ICE. &ldquo;Borrowers with minimal equity &mdash; particularly those who purchased recently &mdash; are often the first to be exposed when home prices soften. These early signs of stress highlight the importance of monitoring borrower-level risk as market conditions evolve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, ICE Home Price Dynamics is beginning to show the impact of softening home prices on equity positions in credit risk transfer (CRT) securitizations with the majority of CRT deals issued in 2023 and 2024 having seen modest upticks in negative equity rates in recent months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As figures from the July Mortgage Monitor bear out, national averages don&rsquo;t tell the full story,&rdquo; said Tim Bowler, President of ICE Mortgage Technology. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing early signs of risk building within specific markets and within specific borrower populations, like borrowers with limited equity or who are behind on student loans. This is when proactive monitoring and data-driven risk management become essential. Identifying and engaging these borrowers early may prevent hardship later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The full July Mortgage Monitor report contains a deeper analysis of May mortgage performance, a housing market update featuring June ICE Home Price Index (HPI) data, an analysis of the impact of student loans on homeowners and a look at loan origination operational trends.</p>
<p>Further detail, including charts, can be found in&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i>this month&rsquo;s Mortgage Monitor report.</p>
<p><span>About the ICE Mortgage Monitor</span></p>
<p>ICE manages the nation&rsquo;s leading repository of loan-level residential mortgage data and performance information covering the majority of the overall market, including tens of millions of loans across the spectrum of credit products and more than 160 million historical records. The ICE Home Price Index provides one of the most complete, accurate and timely measures of home prices available, covering 95% of U.S. residential properties down to the ZIP code level. In addition, the company maintains one of the most robust public property records databases available, covering 99.9% of the U.S. population and households from more than 3,100 counties.</p>
<p>ICE&rsquo;s research experts carefully analyze this data to produce a summary supplemented by dozens of charts and graphs that reflect trend and point-in-time observations for the monthly Mortgage Monitor report.

<title>SET Market Report For June 2025</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/set-market-report-for-june-2025-202577/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Escalating tensions in the Middle East triggered brief global market turbulence as oil prices spiked to USD 70&ndash;80 per barrel. Concurrently, investors closely monitored tariff negotiations following the informal announcement of the agreement between the United States and Vietnam, the first ASEAN nation that reached a tariff reduction deal. Domestically, the Thai equity market faced additional pressure from Thailand-Cambodia border disputes and domestic political uncertainty in June after the Constitutional Court decided to accept the impeachment petition filed by a group of senators and to suspend the Prime Minister from her prime ministerial duties.</p>
<p><b>SET Senior Executive Vice President Soraphol Tulayasathien</b> noted that historical precedents show that developed stock markets typically experience brief volatility from geopolitical conflicts or war declarations before recovering with positive gains, a pattern the Thai market mirrored in June. Analysts from major firms advised investors to maintain investment discipline and stay invested to avoid missing market upturns during swift rebounds and to benefit from strong returns that follow.</p>
<p>As Thailand&rsquo;s GDP growth exceeded projections in the first half of 2025, driven by robust manufacturing performance and accelerated export deliveries, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to hold the policy rate steady. In addition, the Thai ESGX funds attracted over THB 30 billion in fund inflow by the fund subscription deadline, buoying the market amid elevated volatility. SET also launched the JUMP+ program, a growth enabling platform designed to accelerate growth among Thai listed companies and strengthen investor confidence.</p>
<p><b>Key highlights for June 2025</b><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of June 2025, the SET Index fell 5.2 percent MoM to close at 1,089.56 points, outpacing declines at most regional exchanges, with a YTD decrease of 22.2 percent.</li>
<li>SET&rsquo;s and Market for Alternative Investment (mai)&rsquo;s average daily trading value dropped 10.8 percent YoY to THB 39.66 billion (approx. USD 1.22 billion), with a YTD average daily trading value of THB 41.86 billion, decreasing 7.5 percent YoY.</li>
<li>In June 2025, there was a newly-listed company on mai:&nbsp; Nutrition Profess pcl (NUT).</li>
<li>The Thai stock exchange&rsquo;s forward P/E ratio at the end of June 2025 was 11.9 times, below the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 12.4 times. The historical P/E ratio stood at 14.4 times, exceeding the Asian stock market&rsquo;s average of 14.3 times.</li>
<li>Dividend yield ratio at the end of June 2025 was 4.51 percent, higher than the Asian stock markets&rsquo; average of 3.30 percent.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Derivatives Market</b></p>
<ul>
<li>At the end of June 2025, Thailand Futures Exchange (TFEX)&rsquo;s daily trading volume averaged 442,877 contracts, up 24.1 percent from the previous month largely due to the higher trading volume of Single Stock Futures and SET50 Index Futures. The YTD average daily trading volume in 2025 was 438,459 contracts, down 9.4 percent due to the decline in trading volume of Single Stock Futures and Gold Online Futures.</li>

<title>Lloyd’s Managing Agent Authorisation Process To Be Streamlined To Support Growth</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lloyds-managing-agent-authorisation-process-to-be-streamlined-to-support-growth-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/lloyds-managing-agent-authorisation-process-to-be-streamlined-to-support-growth-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s (&lsquo;Lloyd&rsquo;s&rsquo;) have agreed changes to streamline the process of regulatory approval for Lloyd&rsquo;s managing agents, intended to reduce the timeframe for authorisation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the changes, the PRA and FCA will retain their statutory decision-making roles but will make increased use of the assessment work already carried out by Lloyd&rsquo;s. This will make decision-making more concurrent, shortening the process, while maintaining high standards of entry. The changes form part of a wider programme of enhanced collaboration between the three organisations to improve effectiveness, efficiency and reduce duplication in oversight of the Lloyd&rsquo;s market.</p>
<p>Following a successful pilot in 2024 in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market, the new approach will deliver a quicker and clearer process for applicants, helping support the development of the Lloyd's and London Market. It also advances the PRA&rsquo;s and FCA&rsquo;s secondary competitiveness and growth objectives by improving the efficiency of regulatory processes and helping to attract insurance businesses to operate in the UK.</p>
<p><span>Gareth Truran, Executive Director, Insurance Supervision at the PRA</span>&nbsp;said: &lsquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ve worked closely with the FCA and Lloyd&rsquo;s to see how we can streamline our own processes and make as much use as possible of the review work that Lloyd&rsquo;s undertakes. The new approach will improve efficiency while maintaining high quality outcomes in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market, and is aligned with our secondary objectives for competition, competitiveness and growth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Sheree Howard, Executive Director, Authorisations, FCA</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;We are committed to being a smarter regulator, supporting growth and reducing unnecessary burdens on firms whilst maintaining our high standards. Our collective work between the PRA, FCA and Lloyd&rsquo;s to co-ordinate assessments will help ensure that London&rsquo;s world-leading international insurance market continues to thrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span>Caroline Sandeman-Allen, Lloyd&rsquo;s Chief of Market Oversight</span>&nbsp;said: &ldquo;The Lloyd&rsquo;s market is the preeminent hub for global risk, showcasing the best specialist insurance solutions to solve major and complex issues. It&rsquo;s therefore hugely important that we remove barriers to entry wherever possible, while of course maintaining our stringent high expectations. Today&rsquo;s announcement is a great example of what&rsquo;s possible with close collaboration with our regulators and I look forward to the benefits for our market, and industry as a whole. The Lloyd&rsquo;s market is of integral importance to the UK economy, and plays a major role in sustaining our world-leading commercial insurance sector.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>The authorisation of managing agents to operate in the Lloyd&rsquo;s market requires authorisation decisions by the PRA, FCA and the Society of Lloyd&rsquo;s. In 2024, a pilot exercise was initiated to explore how processes could be improved for all parties while maintaining existing standards. This has completed successfully, resulting in a streamlined approach.</li>
<li>If applicants provide a high-quality application &ndash; and are motivated and capable to move at pace - then the combined authorisation process could be completed in around 6 months, significantly quicker than the previous 12-18 months.</li>
<li>Further details on the changes to entry processes will be communicated to prospective new entrants via the usual channels.</li>

<title>ASIC Proposes To Remake Five Financial Reporting-Related Legislative Instruments</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-five-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments-202577/</link>
<guid>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/asic-proposes-to-remake-five-financial-reporting-related-legislative-instruments-202577/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ASIC is seeking feedback on its proposal to remake five legislative instruments relating to financial reporting relief. The legislative instruments are scheduled to sunset on 1 October 2025.</p>
<p>The legislative instruments are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01546/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Non-Reporting Entities) Instrument 2015/841</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01552/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Post Balance Date Reporting) Instrument 2015/842</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01549/asmade/text">ASIC Corporations (Related Scheme Reports) Instrument 2015/839</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L01548/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Stapled Group Reports) Instrument 2015/838</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2015L00737/latest/text">ASIC Corporations (Externally-Administered Bodies) Instrument 2015/251</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have assessed these instruments and determined that they are operating effectively and efficiently. Consequently, they continue to form a necessary and useful part of the legislative framework.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, the effect of these instruments will remain unchanged. We propose to make minor amendments to ensure the instruments are up-to-date and in line with ASIC&rsquo;s current drafting style. We also propose to clarify that the relief in ASIC Instrument 2015/251 is not intended to apply to registrable superannuation entities.</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;<em>Legislation Act 2003</em>, all legislative instruments are automatically repealed, or &lsquo;sunset&rsquo;, after 10 years, unless ASIC takes action to preserve them.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><i>PNGX Group Limited (<b>PNGX Group</b>), the holding company of </i><i>Papua New Guinea&rsquo;s national stock exchange, in partnership with Comrade Trustees Services Limited (<b>CTSL</b>) and the PNG Human Resources Institute (<b>PNGHRI</b>), has delivered transformative financial literacy training to more than 350 human resources professionals in Port Moresby. </i></p>
<p>The most recent session, held on Friday 4 July 2025, welcomed over 220 PNGHRI members from various industries, building on the success of a previous session for 140 participants just three weeks earlier. These sessions form part of PNGX&rsquo;s broader mission to foster financial inclusion, economic empowerment, and responsible investing in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>The comprehensive full-day training covered essential topics including saving, effective budgeting, superannuation, estate planning, and stock market investment. Delivered in collaboration with PNGHRI and CTSL, the initiative is an extension of the highly regarded financial literacy program already being provided by PNGX to CTSL members within the PNG Defence Force.</p>
<p>Participants also gained firsthand insight into the superannuation services offered by CTSL, reinforcing the importance of long-term financial planning and secure retirement strategies.</p>
<h4>Building a More Financially Literate PNG</h4>
<p>&ldquo;PNGX is proud to be a leader in investor education across the country,&rdquo; said Ms. Elizabeth Wamsa, General Manager of PNGX. &ldquo;We believe that a well-informed investment community is the backbone of sustainable economic growth. By equipping HR professionals with these vital skills, we are creating a ripple effect &mdash; empowering organisations to support the financial wellbeing of their employees, families, and communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In developing economies like Papua New Guinea, financial literacy plays a pivotal role in enabling citizens to make informed decisions about their money. A financially educated population is better equipped to build household wealth, participate in capital markets, and contribute to national economic stability. PNGX&rsquo;s education efforts are laying the foundation for a new generation of investors and savers who understand the power of financial planning and long-term investment.</p>
<h4>Impact on Attendees</h4>
<p>Feedback from participants was overwhelmingly positive. Attendees noted that the training not only deepened their personal financial knowledge but also provided practical tools to take back to their organisations. Many expressed confidence in integrating financial wellness into HR policies and PNGX training into staff support programs, a step that could dramatically improve employee satisfaction, productivity, and retention across the country.</p>
<p>The initiative also supports PNGX&rsquo;s long-term goal to establish certificate and diploma-level training for investors, finance professionals, company directors and boards. This vision reflects PNGX&rsquo;s commitment to broadening access to capital markets and ensuring that Papua New Guineans are equipped to actively participate in and benefit from a growing investment economy.</p>

<title>UK Financial Conduct Authority: Redinel Korfuzi And Oerta Korfuzi Sentenced To Combined 11 Years For £1m Insider Dealing And Money Laundering</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><section class="copy-highlighted copy-block component fca-colour--6c1d45 default">
<div class="container">
<p>Redinel Korfuzi sentenced to six years imprisonment, and his sister Oerta Korfuzi, sentenced to five years imprisonment at Southwark Crown Court after being convicted of insider dealing and money laundering worth &pound;1m in a case brought by the FCA.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Redinel Korfuzi took advantage of his position as a research analyst at Janus Henderson. In his role, he had access to confidential information that was likely to have an impact on companies&rsquo; share prices. He shared this with his sister Oerta to rig the system and make money. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr Korfuzi regularly saw emails from companies gauging investor interest on plans to raise equity in the markets or sell large blocks of shares owned by existing shareholders. Within minutes Mr Korfuzi traded in the shares of those companies across a number of accounts, including those operated by his sister.</p>
<p>The case centred on 13 stocks, traded between 17 December 2019 and 25 March 2021, which generated a profit of more than &pound;960,000. The FCA detected suspicious patterns of trading and analysed large sets of trading data to uncover the crime.</p>
<p>The Korfuzis were arrested in March 2021 as part of a search operation, which was carried out alongside the Metropolitan Police.</p>
<p>FCA investigators also uncovered an international money laundering operation. While the source of the cash remains unknown, 173 deposits were made into accounts controlled or operated by the siblings from the UK to Albania. This included nearly &pound;25,000 of cash in English and Scottish bank notes that was found in two bags during the search of a safety deposit box in Knightsbridge.</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight, said:</p>
<p>'The Korfuzis exploited their privileged position and the confidential inside information they had access to. They rigged the system to satisfy their greed.</p>
<p>'We&rsquo;re committed to working with our law enforcement partners to fight financial crime and taking forceful action against individuals who undermine the integrity of our markets.'<br /><br />The FCA has begun proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 to ensure the benefit of the criminality is removed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>On 19 June 2025, Mr Korfuzi and Ms Korfuzi were found guilty of insider dealing and money laundering following an 18 week trial at Southwark Crown Court in a prosecution brought by the FCA.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 20 May 1987.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Oerta Korfuzi&rsquo;s date of birth is 10 September 1988.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 gives the FCA powers to investigate and prosecute insider dealing, defined by The Criminal Justice Act 1993.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi were convicted of conspiracy contrary to section 1 of the Criminal Law Act 1977 to deal as an insider contrary to section 52(1) Criminal Justice Act 1993, between 17 December 2019 and 25 March 2021.</li>
<li>Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi were also convicted of dealing in criminal property contrary to section 327 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 between 01 January 2019 and 25 March 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>The individuals were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/five-individuals-face-conspiracy-commit-insider-dealing-and-money-laundering-charges" title="Five individuals face conspiracy to commit insider dealing and money laundering charges">charged</a>&nbsp;in January 2023. As these offences predate 1 November 2021, when the maximum sentence available increased to 10 years, the insider dealing here is punishable by a fine and/or up to 7 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The offence of money laundering is punishable by a fine or up to 14 years&rsquo; imprisonment.</li>
<li>The prosecution were unable to identify the source of the crime from which the cash derived. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>To report&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/markets/market-abuse" title="Market abuse">market abuse</a>&nbsp;to us or to speak to someone about it, please see our market abuse webpage.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this, it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.</li>
<li>The trial was prosecuted by Tom Forster KC of Red Lion Chambers and Tom Broomfield and Katherine Lloyd of QEB Hollis Whiteman Chambers on behalf of the FCA.</li>

<p>Two individuals have been sentenced to a combined 12 years of imprisonment for their roles in a &pound;1.5m crypto fraud following a prosecution brought by the FCA.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
</div>
</section><section class="copy-block default">
<div class="container">
<p>Between February 2017 and June 2019, Raymondip Bedi, of Bromley, and Patrick Mavanga, of Peckham, cold-called victims and sold fake investments in crypto. At least 65 investors were defrauded and lost &pound;1,541,799.</p>
<p>Mr Bedi has today (Friday 4 July) been sentenced by his Honour Judge Griffiths sitting at Southwark Crown Court to 5 years and 4 months and Mr Mavanga has been sentenced to 6 years and 6 months.</p>
<p>Confiscation proceedings are continuing to recover the benefit from the crimes of both defendants.</p>
<p>In sentencing, His Honour Judge Griffiths remarked that Mr Bedi and Mr Mavanga &lsquo;were both leading players in a conspiracy whereby the victims of the fraud were persuaded to invest in crypto currency consultancy&rsquo; and &lsquo;you conspired to drive a coach and horses through the regulatory system.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bedi and Mavanga ruthlessly defrauded dozens of innocent victims, and it is right that they have received these prison sentences. Criminals need to be clear that there is a cost to committing crime and we will seek to make them pay.'&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<ol>
<li>Raymondip Bedi&rsquo;s date of birth is 09 October 1989.</li>
<li>Patrick Mavanga&rsquo;s date of birth is 24 November 1984.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>The FCA has attempted to contact investors who lost out. Anyone who was scammed by Bedi and Mavanga and has not heard from the FCA should call 0800 111 6768 or email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:operationhickory@fca.org.uk">operationhickory@fca.org.uk</a>. They operated companies including CCX Capital and Astaria Group LLP.</li>
<li>The FCA&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/scamsmart" title="ScamSmart">ScamSmart</a>&nbsp;campaign provides advice on how to spot and avoid investment scams.</li>
<li>The successful prosecution of Bedi and Mavanga follows several other positive results for the FCA in court. In June, it secured convictions against<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/press-releases/fca-secures-convictions-insider-dealing-and-money-laundering-worth-1-million" title="FCA secures convictions for insider dealing and money laundering worth &pound;1 million">&nbsp;Redinel Korfuzi and Oerta Korfuzi</a>.

<title>Europex: The EU ETS Remains The Most Cost-Effective Tool To Achieve The 2040 Emissions Reduction Target</title>
<link>http://www.mondovisione.com/media-and-resources/news/europex-the-eu-ets-remains-the-most-cost-effective-tool-to-achieve-the-2040-emi-202574/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Europex takes note of the Commission&rsquo;s proposal to set a single, binding climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% by 2040 compared to 1990 level, supported by a comprehensive enabling framework. This long-term commitment confirms the EU&rsquo;s continued trajectory towards climate neutrality by 2050 and provides important investment clarity for the pathway to 2040.</p>
<p>The proposals published this week underline the common understanding that carbon markets can and should drive climate action at least cost. To reach the targets set in the Paris Agreement, international cooperation and the scaling of international carbon markets will be crucial. We thus welcome the announced impact assessment on a cautious approach to the use of high-quality credits under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. At the same time, the EU should actively pursue linking the EU ETS with other mature systems, like the UK ETS. This would provide immediate advantages in terms of price discovery, liquidity and European industrial competitiveness.</p>
<p>As the EU prepares its post-2030 framework, the EU ETS must remain at the heart of decarbonisation policy. Strong market principles, transparent and undistorted carbon pricing, liquidity and integrity are essential to ensure continued investor confidence and cost-efficient reductions in emissions. Europex reiterates its support for the gradual and structured integration of additional sectors into a single ETS. A unified market with broad sectoral coverage would deliver deeper liquidity improved market efficiency and stronger price signals. We therefore welcome the European Commission&rsquo;s early signalling of the intention to integrate domestic carbon removals in the EU ETS. The inclusion of carbon removals in the EU ETS could help create a market signal for investment and innovation in these technologies, provided robust accounting rules and high-integrity standards are in place to ensure a high level of trust in the existing well-functioning EU ETS markets.</p>
<p>The announced review of the ETS Directive in 2026 presents a vital opportunity to futureproof the system. As Europe moves towards greater climate ambition, it will be essential to provide regulatory certainty, clear timelines and a stable investment environment. Europex is committed to supporting the development of the EU ETS as a reliable, efficient tool to reduce carbon emissions at least cost.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER monitoring show?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>TSOs&rsquo; balancing actions have declined across most EU gas balancing zones: These interventions accounted for a decreasing share of the physical gas market at EU level.</li>
<li>The changing gas market may be reducing the need for balancing. Lower gas consumption and a smaller physical market may have reduced the need for TSOs to actively balance the system. At the same time, higher gas prices may further incentivise users to stay in balance and avoid charges.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What does ACER recommend?</span></p>
<p>ACER encourages national regulatory authorities to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Periodically review the performance of their balancing regimes and assess whether their design should be refined or revised.</li>

<p><span>The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published a hotfix of its Reporting Framework 4.1 to address a series of technical issues identified in the initial release. This hotfix aims to ensure the consistency and accuracy of the reporting requirements by including some corrections.</span></p>
<p>To support transparency and facilitate implementation by reporting institutions, the EBA has also made available a list of issues and inconsistencies found in the original version of Framework 4.1. This list provides a clear overview of the issues addressed and the corresponding fixes applied in the hotfix release, as well as other issues identified that will be addressed in v4.2 for which an interim solution is proposed.&nbsp;The updated technical package and issues list are available on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eba.europa.eu/risk-and-data-analysis/reporting-frameworks/reporting-framework-41">Reporting framework 4.1 | European Banking Authority</a>&nbsp;webpage.</p>

Originally scheduled to become mandatory from the reference date of December 2025, the new reference date for mandatory xBRL-CSV reporting will be<span>&nbsp;</span>March 2026. This delay is intended to give institutions additional time to adjust their systems and processes to the new format.</p>

<li><span>This is the second listing so far this year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>BME has welcomed IZERTIS as a company listed on the main market of the Stock Exchange, after being listed for more than five years on BME Growth. Pablo Mart&iacute;n, CEO of the company, performed the traditional ringing of the bell at the Palacio de la Bolsa in Madrid.</p>
<p>This milestone signifies the achievement of the key objectives outlined in the company's strategy, and BME's objectives to help companies advance in their financing process through the stock markets.</p>
<p>"This is a success that has a two-way impact. For IZERTIS, it is a key step in its growth trajectory; for BME, it represents the materialisation of one of our main objectives: to support companies in their growth journey through the unique opportunities offered by the financial markets. This milestone shows that we are moving in the right direction and that the goals we have set ourselves at BME are being met, step by step", said Juan Flames, CEO of BME, during IZERTIS' stock market debut.</p>
<p>For his part, Pablo Mart&iacute;n, believes that &lsquo;being listed on the continuous market will help us in a new drive, which like all the previous ones will be very ambitious, sustainable and true&rsquo; and added: "During its almost 29 years of history, Izertis has maintained an impeccable path of sustained growth. We hope that in the coming years we will not only continue on this same path, but also achieve new levels, which will allow Izertis to become one of the benchmark technology consultancies in southern Europe".</p>
<p>The initial listing price has been set at 10.50 euros per share, which represents a market capitalisation of&nbsp;273.79 million euros. The company has started trading under the ticker &lsquo;IZER&rsquo;, the same ticker used during its time at BME Growth. This is the second IPO to take place so far this year.</p>
<p>IZERTIS, which specialises in technology consultancy in Spain, has achieved consistent success since it became part of the BME family, first in the growth markets and now on the main stock market. During this time, the company has acquired a total of 24 new companies, increased its turnover from &euro;48.5 million in 2019 to more than 138.1 million in 2024, and tripled the size of its talented team.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>ACER is establishing a new European Stakeholder Group (ESG) on demand response in the electricity sector. We invite associations that could offer a pan-European perspective on electricity markets to join.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What will the demand response group do?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The Demand Response European Stakeholder Group (DRESG) will act as an EU-level platform where ACER, the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) and the EU Distribution System Operators Entity (EU DSO Entity) engage with stakeholders on key matters of demand response. The group will focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>discussing proposals for terms and conditions or methodologies required by the new network code;</li>
<li>addressing broader issues related to demand response; and</li>
<li>supporting the practical implementation of the network code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through this new stakeholder group, participating associations will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitor the implementation progress of the code, including how newly established processes function at local, regional and EU level.</li>
<li>Share views and feedback on the code&rsquo;s implementation, ensuring stakeholder input is taken into account.</li>
<li>Support more informed decision-making on the methodologies and rules to be developed under the code.</li>
</ul>
<p>By doing so, the group will support the flexibility required by the EU electricity system (increasingly powered by renewable energy), strengthening energy security and advancing the EU&rsquo;s transition to clean energy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who can join?</span></p>
<p>Associations that could offer pan-European views on demand response in electricity markets are encouraged to apply. Bring your insights to the table and ensure that your voice shapes the future of demand response!</p>
<p>Deadline to apply is 15 August 2025, with the first meeting planned for October 2025.</p>
<p><a class="safe---anchor---wc" href="https://mailservice.acer.europa.eu/lists/lt.php?tid=fUsDAANQBVYGBkwMAQVaHVYADVIdCg4GVxpUVFADBlcDAQ4EBggdUFRRVwwCV1sdBFoFUx0GWARRGg1UAQQZBFQHU1IAAFBTUQUERQYEUglbDwdSHQEPAVMaAQYGARlRBVMHHFMHUQVRUFkND1VTUw" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Read more and apply</a>.</p>

<title>Invest Hong Kong Strengthens Web3 And FinTech Ties Between Hong Kong And Japan</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Invest Hong Kong (InvestHK) has successfully concluded an impactful visit to Japan, deepening business ties between the two places. The delegation's primary objectives were to promote two-way business opportunities in Web3 and fintech, and to facilitate strategic technology investments that benefit bothplaces.</p>
<p>From June 30 to July 4, Senior Vice President of Fintech at InvestHK Ms Pauline Fan led a delegation of 16 Hong Kong companies, organisations, universities and a family office to Japan. These included Hong Kong Baptist University, the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and Web3 Harbour. Meetings and events were held in Osaka and Kyoto together with partners in Japan, including HashPort, Headline Asia, and IVC.</p>
<p>In Osaka on June 30 and July 1, delegates engaged with key players in innovation and digital transformation. They met with members of the Osaka Prefectural Government, the Osaka Digital Exchange, the Japan External Trade Organization, SBI Corporation, Plug and Play Japan, the NTT West Corporate Innovation Center and more. These meetings facilitated meaningful exchanges and explorations of new business partnerships and investments. The momentum continued in Kyoto from July 2 to 4 at IVS 2025, the largest start-up conference in Japan, organised by Headline Asia and IVC. Industry leaders and emerging start-ups exchanged insights on fundraising, business partnerships, and breakthrough trends in Web3 and more.</p>
<p>Associate Director-General of Investment Promotion at InvestHK Mr Arnold Lau said &ldquo;This delegation marks a significant milestone in solidifying the collaboration between Hong Kong and Japan in innovation and technology. With a strong influx of innovative ideas and investment flows between both sides, we are entering a pioneering era where groundbreaking technologies in Web3 and fintech are poised to redefine the future of digital economies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This delegation visit came at a perfect time following the Policy Statement 2.0 on the Development of Digital Assets in Hong Kong, issued by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government on June 26. It reinforces the HKSAR Government&rsquo;s commitment to establishing Hong Kong as a global hub for innovation in the digital asset (DA) field. The statement introduces the &ldquo;LEAP&rdquo; framework: Legal and regulatory streamlining, expanding the suite of tokenised products, advancing use cases and cross-sectoral collaboration, and people and partnership development. It sets out a vision for a trusted and innovative DA ecosystem that prioritises risk management and investor protection, while delivering concrete benefits to the real economy and financial markets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our dedicated team at InvestHK is ready to support players in the DA ecosystem, connecting prospective DA service providers with banks and professional services to facilitate their business setup and expansion in Hong Kong,&rdquo; Mr Lau added.</p>
<p><b>Two-way business success driving the agenda forward</b></p>
<p>Japanese firm Zaiko was the first company to establish a presence in Hong Kong through a similar delegation to Japan in 2024, facilitated by InvestHK. As a key portfolio company of Headline Asia, Zaiko serves as a platform that connects creators directly with people through digital events, video streaming, and data analytics. This inward investment exemplifies the potential for Japanese technology expertise to seamlessly merge with the vibrant economic sectors of Hong Kong, such as creative and event industries.</p>
<p>Waffo established a Hong Kong office in 2023 as its strategic hub for Asia and immediately joined the 2024 InvestHK Japan delegation. The company uncovered new opportunities and successfully entered the Japanese market by opening representative offices, collaborating with multiple Japanese clients and launching innovative cross-border payment and risk-management solutions. Leveraging Hong Kong as its launch pad, Waffo once again participated in this year's delegation to further accelerate its growth in Japan.</p>
<p>The Goldian Group is a diversified conglomerate headquartered in Hong Kong with a strong background in real estate development. In recent years, its family office has strategically pivoted towards the fast-evolving field of digital assets. With the support and facilitation from InvestHK, the Group has gained access to cutting-edge market intelligence, advanced fintech applications and high-potential business opportunities in Hong Kong&rsquo;s financial ecosystem. Leveraging these advantages, the Goldian Group joined this year&rsquo;s delegation and formally launched a real estate tokenisation initiative in Japan, marking a key step in cross-border digital asset innovation and regional collaboration.</p>
<p>With these achievements, InvestHK&rsquo;s latest delegation clearly illustrates the rising synergy between Hong Kong and Japan&rsquo;s Web3 and fintech industries, a collaboration that promises a new chapter of ingenuity, growth, and mutual prosperity. As both markets continue to harness innovation and investment, the future looks brighter than ever for such two-way partnerships in the digital economy.</p>

The Vienna Stock Exchange saw further growth in debt listings, as well as in international equities and ETFs.</p>
<p><a class="has-image" href="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/images/fotos/presse/infografiken/vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025.jpg" target="_blank" title="Opens new window"><img alt="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" height="322" src="https://www.wienerborse.at/uploads/u/cms/_processed_/e/a/csm_vienna-stock-exchange-hy12025_82af59c8fc.jpg" title="Trading on the Vienna Stock Exchange HY12025" width="514" /></a></p>
<p>"So far this year, we have seen uncertainty and a lot of movement on the global markets. At the same time, European investment programmes have also boosted the domestic stock market. This has resulted in noticeably higher equity turnover compared to the previous year. The continued growth in the segment direct market plus underpins the need for uncomplicated and practical access to the capital market for companies," says Christoph Boschan, CEO of Wiener B&ouml;rse AG.</p>
<h2>Equity and ETF turnover increased significantly &ndash; strong internationality</h2>
<p>Turnover from equity trading rose to EUR 36.94 billion at the end of the first half of the year (+19.28% vs H1 2024: EUR 30.97 billion). A study by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/institutional-free-float-in-international-hands-2024/" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">S&amp;P Market Intelligence</a>&nbsp;on the institutional free float in the prime market underlines the importance of Austrian stocks for international investors. 92.3% of the freely tradable shares in the portfolios of large investors &ndash; i.e. those holding at least four per cent of the free float &ndash; are held by international asset managers. The majority originates from the USA, accounting for 34%.</p>
<h2>Extensive expansion of ETFs and international securities</h2>
<p>Trading in international securities and ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) on the Vienna Stock Exchange has also increased significantly. As of today,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.wienerborse.at/en/news/vienna-stock-exchange-news/etf-offering-expanded-07042025" target="_blank" title="Opens new window">50 additional ETFs</a>&nbsp;can be traded on the Vienna Stock Exchange at domestic fees. As a result, the ETF offering on the Vienna Stock Exchange has more than doubled this year to over 280 index funds. The attractiveness of ETF investments is also reflected in trading turnover, which reached an all-time high of over EUR 400 million in the first half of the year. In addition, the international global market segment was expanded several times within the last months: 68 securities from around the world have been included in trading since the beginning of the year, most recently the Swiss SMI index blue chips. Around 900 securities from 28 countries can now be traded in euros, at domestic fees and during Vienna trading hours.</p>
<h2>ATX including dividends at record level</h2>
<p>The ATX Total Return &ndash; a performance index like the German DAX &ndash; is one of the top international performers with its year-to-date growth. On 6 June, the national index reached a new all-time high of 10,820.43 points. By 30 June, the Austrian leading index, including dividends, has risen by 26.38% (ATX without dividends: 20.95%), putting it ahead of the DAX (20.09%), Euro Stoxx 50 (8.32%) and MSCI World (8.59%). The market capitalisation of all domestic companies listed in Vienna amounted to around EUR 153 billion at this time.</p>
<p>"The European stock market is on the upswing and Austrian companies are part of this dynamic. They stand out with solid dividends, moderate valuations and strong positioning in the growth region of Central and Eastern Europe," says Boschan.</p>
<h2>Debt listings almost at the overall level of 2024</h2>
<p>The number of debt listings continues to grow rapidly. At the end of June, 12,144 new listings were recorded, almost as many as in the entire previous year (2024: 13,443). The new listings came from over 30 countries, spread across around 360 issuers. This corresponds to around 24% more issuers than in the same period of the previous year. In total, the Vienna Stock Exchange currently services around 1,200 issuers from 44 countries.</p>

<p>An investigation opened in November 2024 by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA) &ndash; Te Mana Tātai Hokohoko &ndash; into senior living sector financier, Senior Trust Capital Limited (<span>STC</span>), is ongoing. STC is an issuer under a regulated offer of shares. On 14 May 2025, STC voluntarily withdrew its public offer of shares. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The scope of the investigation includes considering disclosures made by STC in its previous product disclosure statement (PDS) and associated advertising material and whether those disclosures complied with Parts 2 and 3 of the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013.</p>
<p>Concurrently with the investigation, the FMA has engaged with STC about aspects of its business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of discussions between the FMA and STC, the FMA has asked STC to disclose certain information to its investors. STC has now done so as part of an STC investor communication dated 27 June 2025, which can be found here:</p>
